National dataset of Australia's Ramsar Wetlands.
The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (the Ramsar Convention) was signed in Ramsar, Iran on 2 February 1971. The Ramsar Convention aims to halt the worldwide loss of wetlands and to conserve, through wise use and management, those that remain. The Convention encourages member countries to nominate sites containing representative, rare or unique wetlands, or that are important for conserving biological diversity, to the List of Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar sites). Australia was one of the first countries to become a Contracting Party to the Convention and designated the world's first Ramsar site, Cobourg Peninsula, in 1974.
This project was initiated by the Wetlands Section of the Australian Government Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. Spatial data was sourced from the relevant State and Territory agencies and compiled into a single national coverage.

The projections are not official ABS data and are owned by Geoscience Australia.
These projections are for Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2s) and Local Government Areas (LGAs), and are projected out from a base population as at 30 June 2022, by age and sex. Projections are for 30 June 2023 to 2032, with results disaggregated by age and sex.

Method
The cohort-component method was used for these projections. In this method, the base population is projected forward annually by calculating the effect of births, deaths and migration (the components) within each age-sex cohort according to the specified fertility, mortality and overseas and internal migration assumptions.
The projected usual resident population by single year of age and sex was produced in four successive stages – national, state/territory, capital city/rest of state, and finally SA2s. Assumptions were made for each level and the resulting projected components and population are constrained to the geographic level above for each year.
These projections were derived from a combination of assumptions published in Population Projections, Australia, 2022 (base) to 2071 on 23 November 2023, and historical patterns observed within each state/territory.

Projections – capital city/rest of state regions
The base population is 30 June 2022 Estimated Resident Population (ERP) as published in National, state and territory population, June 2022.
For fertility, the total fertility rate (at the national level) is based on the medium assumption used in Population Projections, Australia, 2022 (base) to 2071, of 1.6 babies per woman being phased in from 2022 levels over five years to 2027, before remaining steady for the remainder of the projection span. Observed state/territory, and greater capital city level fertility differentials were applied to the national data so that established trends in the state and capital city/rest of state relativities were preserved.
Mortality rates are based on the medium assumption used in Population Projections, Australia, 2022 (base) to 2071, and assume that mortality rates will continue to decline across Australia with state/territory differentials persisting. State/territory and capital city/rest of state differentials were used to ensure projected deaths are consistent with the historical trend.
Annual net overseas migration (NOM) is based on the medium assumption used in Population Projections, Australia, 2022 (base) to 2071, with an assumed gain (at the national level) of 400,000 in 2022-23, increasing to 315,000 in 2023-24, then declining to 225,000 in 2026-27, after which NOM is assumed to remain constant. State and capital city/rest of state shares are based on a weighted average of NOM data from 2010 to 2019 at the state and territory level to account for the impact of COVID-19.
For internal migration, net gains and losses from states and territories and capital city/rest of state regions are based on the medium assumption used in Population Projections, Australia, 2022 (base) to 2071, and assume that net interstate migration will trend towards long-term historic average flows.

Projections – Statistical Areas Level 2
The base population for each SA2 is the estimated resident population in each area by single year of age and sex, at 30 June 2022, as published in Regional population by age and sex, 2022 on 28 September 2023.
The SA2-level fertility and mortality assumptions were derived by combining the medium scenario state/territory assumptions from Population Projections, Australia, 2022 (base) to 2071, with recent fertility and mortality trends in each SA2 based on annual births (by sex) and deaths (by age and sex) published in Regional Population, 2021-22 and Regional Population by Age and Sex, 2022.
Assumed overseas and internal migration for each SA2 is based on SA2-specific annual overseas and internal arrivals and departures estimates published in Regional Population, 2021-22 and Regional Population by Age and Sex, 2022. The internal migration data was strengthened with SA2-specific data from the 2021 Census, based on the usual residence one year before Census night question. Assumptions were applied by SA2, age and sex.
Assumptions were adjusted for some SA2s, to provide more plausible future population levels, and age and sex distribution changes, including areas where populations may not age over time, for example due to significant resident student and defence force populations. Most assumption adjustments were made via the internal migration component. For some SA2s with zero or a very small population base, but where significant population growth is expected, replacement migration age/sex profiles were applied.
All SA2-level components and projected projections are constrained to the medium series of capital city/rest of state data in Population Projections, Australia, 2022 (base) to 2071.

Projections – Local Government Areas
The base population for each LGA is the estimated resident population in each area by single year of age and sex, at 30 June 2022, as published in Regional population by age and sex, 2022 on 28 September 2023.
Projections for 30 June 2023 to 2032 were created by converting from the SA2-level population projections to LGAs by age and sex. This was done using an age-specific population correspondence, where the data for each year of the projection span were converted based on 2021 population shares across SA2s. The LGA and SA2 projections are congruous in aggregation as well as in isolation.
Unlike the projections prepared at SA2 level, no LGA-specific projection assumptions were used.

Nature of projections and considerations for usage
The nature of the projection method and inherent fluctuations in population dynamics mean that care should be taken when using and interpreting the projection results. The projections are not forecasts, but rather illustrate future changes which would occur if the stated assumptions were to apply over the projection period.
These projections do not attempt to allow for non-demographic factors such as major government policy decisions, economic factors, catastrophes, wars and pandemics, which may affect future demographic behaviour.
To illustrate a range of possible outcomes, alternative projection series for national, state/territory and capital city/rest of state areas, using different combinations of fertility, mortality, overseas and internal migration assumptions, are prepared. Alternative series are published in Population Projections, Australia, 2022 (base) to 2071. Only one series of SA2-level projections was prepared for this product.
Population projections can take account of planning and other decisions by governments known at the time the projections were derived, including sub-state projections published by each state and territory government. The ABS generally does not have access to the policies or decisions of commonwealth, state and local governments and businesses that assist in accurately forecasting small area populations.
Migration, especially internal migration, accounts for the majority of projected population change for most SA2s. Volatile and unpredictable small area migration trends, especially in the short-term, can have a significant effect on longer-term projection results. Care therefore should be taken with SA2s with small total populations and very small age-sex cells, especially at older ages.
While these projections are calculated at the single year of age level, small numbers, and fluctuations across individual ages in the base population and projection assumptions limit the reliability of SA2-level projections at single year of age level. These fluctuations reduce and reliability improves when the projection results are aggregated to broader age groups such as the five-year age bands in this product. For areas with small elderly populations, results aggregated to 65 and over are more reliable than for the individual age groups above 65.
With the exception of areas with high planned population growth, SA2s with a base total population of less than 500 have generally been held constant for the projection period in this product as their populations are too small to be reliably projected at all, however their (small) age/sex distributions may change slightly. These SA2s are listed in the appendix.
The base (2022) SA2 population estimates and post-2022 projections by age and sex include small artificial cells, including 1s and 2s. These are the result of a confidentialisation process and forced additivity, to control SA2 and capital city/rest of state age/sex totals, being applied to their original values.
SA2s and LGAs in this product are based on the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) boundaries as at the 2021 Census (ASGS Edition 3). For further information, see Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Edition 3.

Source Information
This dataset is derived from the National Near-Real-Time Bushfire Boundaries product. 
The project team initially identified a list of potential source data through jurisdictional websites and the Emergency Management LINK catalogue. These were then confirmed by each jurisdiction through the EMSINA National and EMSINA Developers networks.
This Webservice contains authoritative data sourced from:

Australian Capital Territory - Emergency Service Agency (ESA)
New South Wales - Rural Fire Service (RFS)
Queensland - Queensland Fire and Emergency Service (QFES)
South Australia - Country Fire Service (CFS)
Tasmania - Tasmania Fire Service (TFS)
Victoria – Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP)
Western Australia – Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES)

The completeness of the data within this webservice is reliant on each jurisdictional source and the information they elect to publish into their Operational Bushfire Boundary webservices.
Known Limitations:

This dataset does not contain information from the Northern Territory government.
This dataset contains a subset of the Queensland bushfire boundary data. The Queensland ‘Operational’ feed that is consumed within this National Database displays a the last six (6) months of incident boundaries. In order to make this dataset best represent a ‘near-real-time’ or current view of operational bushfire boundaries Geoscience Australia has filtered the Queensland data to only incorporate the last two (2) weeks data.
Geoscience Australia is aware of duplicate data (features) may appear within this dataset. This duplicate data is commonly represented in the regions around state borders where it is operationally necessary for one jurisdiction to understand cross border situations. Care must be taken when summing the values to obtain a total area burnt.
The data within this aggregated National product is a spatial representation of the input data received from the custodian agencies.  Therefore, data quality and data completion will vary.  If you wish to assess more information about specific jurisdictional data and/or data feature(s) it is strongly recommended that you contact the appropriate custodian.

The accuracy of the data attributes within this webservice is reliant on each jurisdictional source and the information they elect to publish into their Operational Bushfire Boundary webservices.
Note: Geoscience Australia has, where possible, attempted to align the data to the (as of October 2023) draft National Current Incident Extent Feeds Data Dictionary. However, this has not been possible in all cases. Work to progress this alignment will be undertaken after the publication of this dataset, once this project enters a maintenance period.

Lineage Statement
Version 1 (2021/22):
A 2021/22 version of the National 3 Hourly Cumulative Bushfire Boundaries dataset was produced by Geoscience Australia. This product was owned and managed by Geoscience Australia, who provided both development and delivery.
Work on Version 1 of this dataset began in August 2021 with delivery occurring in September 2021. The dataset was discontinued in May 2022 due to insufficient Government funding.
Version 2 (2023/25):
A 2023/25 version of National Near-Real-Time Bushfire Boundaries dataset is produced by Geoscience Australia under funding from the National Bushfire Intelligence Capability (NBIC) - CSIRO.  NBIC and Geoscience Australia have also partnered with the EMSINA Group to assist with accessing and delivering this dataset. This dataset is the first time where the jurisdictional attributes are aligned to AFAC’s National Bushfire Schema.
Work on Version 2 began in August 2023 and was released in late 2023 under formal access arrangements with the States and Territories.

State and capital city/rest of state shares are based on a weighted average of NOM data from 2010 to 2019 at the state and territory level to account for the impact of COVID-19.
For internal migration, net gains and losses from states and territories and capital city/rest of state regions are based on the medium assumption used in Population Projections, Australia, 2022 (base) to 2071, and assume that net interstate migration will trend towards long-term historic average flows.

Projections – Statistical Areas Level 2
The base population for each SA2 is the estimated resident population in each area by single year of age and sex, at 30 June 2022, as published in Regional population by age and sex, 2022 on 28 September 2023.
The SA2-level fertility and mortality assumptions were derived by combining the medium scenario state/territory assumptions from Population Projections, Australia, 2022 (base) to 2071, with recent fertility and mortality trends in each SA2 based on annual births (by sex) and deaths (by age and sex) published in Regional Population, 2021-22 and Regional Population by Age and Sex, 2022.
Assumed overseas and internal migration for each SA2 is based on SA2-specific annual overseas and internal arrivals and departures estimates published in Regional Population, 2021-22 and Regional Population by Age and Sex, 2022. The internal migration data was strengthened with SA2-specific data from the 2021 Census, based on the usual residence one year before Census night question. Assumptions were applied by SA2, age and sex.
Assumptions were adjusted for some SA2s, to provide more plausible future population levels, and age and sex distribution changes, including areas where populations may not age over time, for example due to significant resident student and defence force populations. Most assumption adjustments were made via the internal migration component. For some SA2s with zero or a very small population base, but where significant population growth is expected, replacement migration age/sex profiles were applied.
All SA2-level components and projected projections are constrained to the medium series of capital city/rest of state data in Population Projections, Australia, 2022 (base) to 2071.

Projections – Local Government Areas
The base population for each LGA is the estimated resident population in each area by single year of age and sex, at 30 June 2022, as published in Regional population by age and sex, 2022 on 28 September 2023.
Projections for 30 June 2023 to 2032 were created by converting from the SA2-level population projections to LGAs by age and sex. This was done using an age-specific population correspondence, where the data for each year of the projection span were converted based on 2021 population shares across SA2s. The LGA and SA2 projections are congruous in aggregation as well as in isolation.
Unlike the projections prepared at SA2 level, no LGA-specific projection assumptions were used.

Nature of projections and considerations for usage
The nature of the projection method and inherent fluctuations in population dynamics mean that care should be taken when using and interpreting the projection results. The projections are not forecasts, but rather illustrate future changes which would occur if the stated assumptions were to apply over the projection period.
These projections do not attempt to allow for non-demographic factors such as major government policy decisions, economic factors, catastrophes, wars and pandemics, which may affect future demographic behaviour.
To illustrate a range of possible outcomes, alternative projection series for national, state/territory and capital city/rest of state areas, using different combinations of fertility, mortality, overseas and internal migration assumptions, are prepared. Alternative series are published in Population Projections, Australia, 2022 (base) to 2071. Only one series of SA2-level projections was prepared for this product.
Population projections can take account of planning and other decisions by governments known at the time the projections were derived, including sub-state projections published by each state and territory government. The ABS generally does not have access to the policies or decisions of commonwealth, state and local governments and businesses that assist in accurately forecasting small area populations.
Migration, especially internal migration, accounts for the majority of projected population change for most SA2s. Volatile and unpredictable small area migration trends, especially in the short-term, can have a significant effect on longer-term projection results. Care therefore should be taken with SA2s with small total populations and very small age-sex cells, especially at older ages.
While these projections are calculated at the single year of age level, small numbers, and fluctuations across individual ages in the base population and projection assumptions limit the reliability of SA2-level projections at single year of age level. These fluctuations reduce and reliability improves when the projection results are aggregated to broader age groups such as the five-year age bands in this product. For areas with small elderly populations, results aggregated to 65 and over are more reliable than for the individual age groups above 65.
With the exception of areas with high planned population growth, SA2s with a base total population of less than 500 have generally been held constant for the projection period in this product as their populations are too small to be reliably projected at all, however their (small) age/sex distributions may change slightly. These SA2s are listed in the appendix.
The base (2022) SA2 population estimates and post-2022 projections by age and sex include small artificial cells, including 1s and 2s. These are the result of a confidentialisation process and forced additivity, to control SA2 and capital city/rest of state age/sex totals, being applied to their original values.
SA2s and LGAs in this product are based on the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) boundaries as at the 2021 Census (ASGS Edition 3). For further information, see Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Edition 3.

Source information
Where updates were not completed the primary information sources were used to identify and attribute the petrol stations from the owner/operator websites. In the majority of instances, the websites provided a location list or map application and the petrol stations location were then validated against imagery. For the New South Wales update the NSW Fuel API was used. For Queensland update the Fuel Prices direct API was used. For Western Australia update the FuelWatch RSS feed was used. The Geocoded National Address File (GNAF) data was then used to address match data though attributional and spatial methods.
Catalog entry: Petrol Stations
Lineage statement
The petrol stations dataset was released as a subset of the Liquid Fuels Facilities as a web service in February 2016 and has been used within the following dataset where updates were not available. It was initially digitized in 2011/2012 from the library of imagery held within Geoscience Australia. Imagery used ranged from 0.15m to 2.5m resolution. The new updates to the states include New South Wales receiving a complete update via the NSW Fuel API that is supported by the Department of Customer Service. Queensland receiving a complete update using the Queensland Fuel Prices direct API supported by the Department of Energy and Public Works. Western Australia receiving a partial update with newly identified data utilising the FuelWatch RSS feed which is supported by the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety. The GNAF data was then used to complete a string match on the address names in the initial instance. Unmatched records we then ran through a near neighbour algorithm in an attempt to address match at 10m, 20m, 30m, 50m, 60m and 100m intervals. The dataset contains both the original address and attribute information along with the GNAF unique PID and relevant address attribution.

This dataset is a subset of Australian Geological Provinces 2018,1:1 Million Scale and describes the extents of Archean to Paleoproterozoic sedimentary basins of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
The Australian Geological Provinces Database contains descriptions and spatial extents of the fundamental geological elements of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
Province types include sedimentary basins, tectonic provinces such as cratons and orogens, igneous provinces, and metallogenic provinces.
Spatial data has been captured largely at approximately 1:1M scale for intended use between 1:2M and 1:5M scale. This edition (2018.01) of the dataset is NOT a complete representation of all of Australia's geological provinces.
Further work is required to complete the national geological province collection. Additionally, not all the provinces supplied herein have undergone a rigorous quality assurance (QA) check to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their descriptions.
Where possible, provinces have been attributed with their age, contained lithostratigraphic units, relationships to other provinces, geological history, mineral resource occurrences, and selected published references.
The geological definition of some provinces is contentious.
While every effort has been made to achieve a consensus interpretation of each province, including significant collaboration with state and territory geological surveys, scientific debate may still occur about the nature and extent of some provinces. The full 2D spatial extent (ie, including the extent of a province under any overlying cover material) of provinces has been captured.

This dataset is a subset of Surface Geology of Australia 2012,1:2.5M Scale symbolised by lithostratigraphic classification.
Attributes include summary geological information for each unit polygon, and metadata about the capture and recommended portrayal of the polygons.
The 1:2.5M scale geology of Australia data documents the distribution and age of major stratigraphic, intrusive and medium to high-grade metamorphic rock units of onshore Australia.
This edition contains the same geological content as previous editions (1998 to 2010), but is structured according to Geoscience Australia's 2012 data standards.
The data set was compiled to use at scales between 1:2,500,000 and 1:5,000,000 inclusive.
The units distinguished/mapped mainly represent stratigraphic supergroups, regional intrusive associations and regional metamorphic complexes.
Groupings of Precambrian units in the time-space diagram are generally separated by major time breaks; Phanerozoic units are grouped according to stratigraphic age i.e. System/Period.
The time-space diagram has the added benefit that it provides a summary of units currently included on the themes.
The method used to distinguish sedimentary and many volcanic units varies for each geological eon as follows:

Cenozoic units are morphological units which emphasise the relationship of the sedimentary fill to the landscape;
Mesozoic units are regionally extensive to continent-wide time-rock units which emphasise the System of Period(s);
Paleozoic units are stratotectonic units that emphasise either the dominant System or Period(s) or the range of Periods;
Proterozoic units are commonly regional stratotectonic units - separated by major time breaks and split into the Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic Eras - which are generally unique to each cratonic region; and
Archean units are regional lithological units grouped into broad time divisions.

Metamorphic units are lithological units which emphasise the metamorphic facies and timing of the last major metamorphic event.
Igneous units are regional units which emphasise the dominant lithology and are grouped into broad time divisions.

Geoscience Australia catalog entry: Surface Geology of Australia 1:2.5 million scale dataset 2012 edition
Lineage Statement
The geological content of the 2012 edition of the 1:2.5M surface geology of Australia is the same as the previous 2010 edition (ANZLIC dataset ID = ANZCW0703013817), restructured to comply with 2012 Geoscience Australia and international data standards.
The original data was compiled from digital data, mainly at 1:2 500 000 scale, supplied by AGSO, GSWA, NTGS, PIRSA, GSQ, GSTAS, GSNSW and GSVIC and from data obtained from many other groups.
In order to synthesise data from a variety of sources into a coherent product, the degree and nature of modification of the source data varied from case to case.
Cenozoic and Mesozoic units were derived from sources, including the Cenozoic Paleogeographic Atlas of Australia (Landford et al., 1995), the Geology of Australia 1986 and a compilation of Cenozoic basins in the Alice Springs region by B.R. Senior et al. (AGSO Record 1994/66).
The Phanerozoic units of southeastern Australia are substantially a modification of the 1:2 500 000 scale map entitled ""Stratotectonic and Structural Elements of the Tasman Fold Belt System"".
The geology of Tasmania is a generalisation of data assembled as part of the TASGO project (a GSTAS and AGSO/AGCRC venture completed in 1997).
The geology of South Australia is a highly generalised modification of the 1993 1:2 000 000 scale Geological Map of South Australia.
For the Precambrian compilation, much of the geology of Western Australia has been derived from the Geological Map of Western Australia, 1988 with some modifications.
The geology of the Kimberley, Halls Creek, Tanami and Arunta regions has been updated in line with recent mapping and some input from magnetic interpretation to emphasise relationships with the Tanami region.
The geology of the Amadeus region has been generalised from the 1:1 000 000 scale ""Structural Map of the Amadeus Basin"" (Compiler A.J. Stewart).
The geology of the Musgrave region has been re-compiled and simplified.
The geology of North Queensland has been generalised by D. Palfreyman and D. Pillinger from the ""North Qld Geology, 1997"" 1:1 000 000 scale map (compilers J.H.C. Bain & D. Haipola).

This dataset is a subset of Australian Geological Provinces 2018, 1:1 Million Scale and describes the Cenozoic sedimentary basins of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
The Australian Geological Provinces Database contains descriptions and spatial extents of the fundamental geological elements of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
Province types include sedimentary basins, tectonic provinces such as cratons and orogens, igneous provinces, and metallogenic provinces.
Spatial data has been captured largely at approximately 1:1M scale for intended use between 1:2M and 1:5M scale. This edition (2018.01) of the dataset is NOT a complete representation of all of Australia's geological provinces.
Further work is required to complete the national geological province collection. Additionally, not all the provinces supplied herein have undergone a rigorous quality assurance (QA) check to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their descriptions.
Where possible, provinces have been attributed with their age, contained lithostratigraphic units, relationships to other provinces, geological history, mineral resource occurrences, and selected published references.
The geological definition of some provinces is contentious.
While every effort has been made to achieve a consensus interpretation of each province, including significant collaboration with state and territory geological surveys, scientific debate may still occur about the nature and extent of some provinces. The full 2D spatial extent (ie, including the extent of a province under any overlying cover material) of provinces has been captured.
Additionally, the extent of outcrop of some provinces has also been captured. Where possible, the full extent outlines of provinces have been attributed with information about the source, accuracy, and observation method of those lines.

This publication is the fourth in an annual series that uses vehicle telematics data to provide measures of traffic congestion for freight vehicles for selected routes across Australia’s five mainland state capital cities—Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. The selected routes comprise the major motorways, highways and arterial roads within each city that service both passenger and freight vehicles. This release includes measures for 71 routes. The estimates presented in this report cover calendar year 2022, and include comparisons with 2021 traffic congestion levels.
This is the first year since the initial report, in 2019, where none of Australia’s capital cities experienced major lockdowns as part of the COVID-19 pandemic, and city-wide congestion levels have more or less returned to pre-pandemic levels. In particular, city-wide vehicle congestion, as measured by the mean excess time index, increased (worsened) in Sydney, Melbourne and, to a lesser extent, Adelaide between 2021 and 2022, but decreased (improved) in Brisbane and Perth. Many individual motorway routes exhibit increased congestion at morning and afternoon peaks in 2022, compared to 2020 and 2021. On some routes measured congestion is still lower than the pre-pandemic results in 2019. On other routes, congestion peaks exceed 2019 levels. Copies of the data displayed in the report are available here and on data.gov.au.

BITRE used freight telematics data to collate speeds experienced by freight vehicles on individual road segments. A sample of heavy vehicles was used to calculate median travel time for each road segment. Open Street Map (OSM) road segments were used. The methodology used to process the data is available in the BITRE github repository and on the National Freight Data Hub data catalogue.
A snapshot of the OSM data was taken in the January of the following year of analysis as it is the best representation of Australian roads as they were in that year.

It is topologically correct in relation to published jurisdictional land borders and the Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF).
The purpose of this product is to provide:

a building block which enables development of other national datasets;

visualisation of these borders as cartographic depiction on a map.

Although this service depicts land borders, it is not nor does it purport to be a legal definition of these borders. Therefore it cannot and must not be used for those use-cases pertaining to legal context.
This foundation dataset consists of edges (polylines) representing mediated segments of state and/or territory borders, connected at the nodes and terminated at the coastline defined as the Mean High Water Mark (MHWM) tidal boundary.  These polylines are attributed to convey information about provenance of the source.
It is envisaged that land borders will be topologically interoperable with the future national coastline dataset/s, currently being built through the ICSM coastline capture collaboration program.  Topological interoperability will enable closure of land mass polygon, permitting spatial analysis operations such as vector overlay, intersect, or raster map algebra.

Source information
Catalog entry: Australia's Land Borders
The Land Borders dataset is created using a range of source data including:

Australian Capital Territory data was sourced from the ACT Government GeoHub – ‘ACT Boundary’. No changes have been made to the polylines or vertices of the source data.
In the absence of any custodian published border for Jervis Bay – New South Wales, a border has been constructed from the boundary of the NSW cadastre supplied by NSW Spatial Services. Geoscience Australia’s GEODATA TOPO 250K data was considered as an alternative, however, that border terminated short of the coastline as it stops at the shoreline of the major water bodies. Therefore, a decision was made to use the NSW and OT supplied cadastre to create a new representation of the Jervis Bay border that continued to the coastline (MHWM), in place of the TOPO 250K data.
In the absence of publicly available data from New South Wales, the land borders for New South Wales have been constructed using the data of adjoining states Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. This approach is agreeable to New South Wales Government for this interim product.
In the absence of publicly available data from the Northern Territory the land borders for the Northern Territory have been constructed using the data of adjoining states Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia. This approach is agreeable to Northern Territory Government for this interim product.
Queensland state border and coastline data have been download from the Queensland Spatial, Catalogue – QSpatial.
Publicly available data for the state borders of South Australia was downloaded from data.gov.au and is ‘SA State Boundary - PSMA Administrative Boundaries’. Downloaded as a file geodatabase in GDA2020.
Victorian state border data has been downloaded from the Victorian state Government Spatial Datamart, it is titled ‘FR_FRAMEWORK_AREA_LINE’. The Victorian state border data was used for the NSW/VIC section of border due to the absence of any publicly available data from New South Wales for this section of the border.
Western Australian state border data was downloaded from the WA Government as publicly available. The Western Australia state border data has been used for the WA/NT section of the border due to the absence of publicly available data from Northern Territory for this section of the border. Selecting the SA data for the WA/SA border would introduce mismatches with the WA cadastre. It would also not improve the SA relationship with the SA cadastre. Using the WA data for the WA/SA section of the border aligns each state with its own cadastre without causing overlaps.

Lineage statement
At the southwest end of the NT/SA/WA border the South Australian data for the border was edited by moving the end vertex ~1.7m to correctly create the intersection of the 3 states (SA/WA/NT).
At the southeast end of the NT/QLD/SA border the South Australian data for the border was edited by moving the end vertex ~0.4m to correctly create the intersection of the 3 states (NT/SA/QLD).
Queensland data was used for the NT/QLD border and the QLD/NSW border due to the absence of publicly available data from the Northern Territory for these section of the border.  Data published by Queensland also included a border sections running westwards along the southern Northern Territory border and southwards along the western New South Wales border.  These two sections were excluded from the product as they are not within the state of Queensland. Queensland data was also used in the entirety for the SA/QLD segment of the land borders.  Although the maximum overlap between SA and QLD state border data was less than ~5m (and varied along the border), the Queensland data closely matched its own cadastre and that of South Australia.  The South Australian data overlapped the Queensland data, it also did not match the South Australian cadastre.  Therefore, a decision to use the Queensland data for the QLD/SA section of the border ensured the best possible topological consistency with the published cadastre of each state.
The South Australian/Victorian state border, north-south, were generally very similar with some minor deviations from each other from less than 1m to ~60m (there is one instance of deviation of 170m). The section of border that follows the Murray River is matched, for the most part by both states. Over three quarters of the border running along the river is matched with both states. There is a mismatch between the states in the last quarter of the border along the river, the northern section, however, both states still have the border running inside, or along, the river polygon (Surface hydrology), the Victorian data was chosen for this section purely for consistency as the Victorian data was used for the preceding arcs.
Overall, the Victorian data was selected for use as the South Australia/Victoria land border. After taking the existing cadastre and GNAF points into account and it did not introduce extra errors into the relationship between the land borders and the cadastre of either state. In parts, it improved the relationship between the South Australian cadastre and the SA/VIC state border.
This interim product will be updated when all states and territories have published agreed, authoritative representations of their land borders. This product will also be updated to include land mass polygons at time when the Coastline Capture Program is complete. This dataset is GDA 2020 compliant - transformed into GDA2020 from it's original source datum. Reference System Code 2020.00.

Source information
Catalog entry: Australia's Land Borders
The Land Borders dataset is created using a range of source data including:

Australian Capital Territory data was sourced from the ACT Government GeoHub – ‘ACT Boundary’. No changes have been made to the polylines or vertices of the source data.
In the absence of any custodian published border for Jervis Bay – New South Wales, a border has been constructed from the boundary of the NSW cadastre supplied by NSW Spatial Services. Geoscience Australia’s GEODATA TOPO 250K data was considered as an alternative, however, that border terminated short of the coastline as it stops at the shoreline of the major water bodies. Therefore, a decision was made to use the NSW and OT supplied cadastre to create a new representation of the Jervis Bay border that continued to the coastline (MHWM), in place of the TOPO 250K data.
In the absence of publicly available data from New South Wales, the land borders for New South Wales have been constructed using the data of adjoining states Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. This approach is agreeable to New South Wales Government for this interim product.
In the absence of publicly available data from the Northern Territory the land borders for the Northern Territory have been constructed using the data of adjoining states Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia. This approach is agreeable to Northern Territory Government for this interim product.
Queensland state border and coastline data have been download from the Queensland Spatial, Catalogue – QSpatial.
Publicly available data for the state borders of South Australia was downloaded from data.gov.au and is ‘SA State Boundary - PSMA Administrative Boundaries’. Downloaded as a file geodatabase in GDA2020.
Victorian state border data has been downloaded from the Victorian state Government Spatial Datamart, it is titled ‘FR_FRAMEWORK_AREA_LINE’. The Victorian state border data was used for the NSW/VIC section of border due to the absence of any publicly available data from New South Wales for this section of the border.
Western Australian state border data was downloaded from the WA Government as publicly available. The Western Australia state border data has been used for the WA/NT section of the border due to the absence of publicly available data from Northern Territory for this section of the border. Selecting the SA data for the WA/SA border would introduce mismatches with the WA cadastre. It would also not improve the SA relationship with the SA cadastre. Using the WA data for the WA/SA section of the border aligns each state with its own cadastre without causing overlaps.

Lineage statement
At the southwest end of the NT/SA/WA border the South Australian data for the border was edited by moving the end vertex ~1.7m to correctly create the intersection of the 3 states (SA/WA/NT).
At the southeast end of the NT/QLD/SA border the South Australian data for the border was edited by moving the end vertex ~0.4m to correctly create the intersection of the 3 states (NT/SA/QLD).
Queensland data was used for the NT/QLD border and the QLD/NSW border due to the absence of publicly available data from the Northern Territory for these section of the border.  Data published by Queensland also included a border sections running westwards along the southern Northern Territory border and southwards along the western New South Wales border.  These two sections were excluded from the product as they are not within the state of Queensland. Queensland data was also used in the entirety for the SA/QLD segment of the land borders.  Although the maximum overlap between SA and QLD state border data was less than ~5m (and varied along the border), the Queensland data closely matched its own cadastre and that of South Australia.  The South Australian data overlapped the Queensland data, it also did not match the South Australian cadastre.  Therefore, a decision to use the Queensland data for the QLD/SA section of the border ensured the best possible topological consistency with the published cadastre of each state.
The South Australian/Victorian state border, north-south, were generally very similar with some minor deviations from each other from less than 1m to ~60m (there is one instance of deviation of 170m). The section of border that follows the Murray River is matched, for the most part by both states. Over three quarters of the border running along the river is matched with both states. There is a mismatch between the states in the last quarter of the border along the river, the northern section, however, both states still have the border running inside, or along, the river polygon (Surface hydrology), the Victorian data was chosen for this section purely for consistency as the Victorian data was used for the preceding arcs.
Overall, the Victorian data was selected for use as the South Australia/Victoria land border. After taking the existing cadastre and GNAF points into account and it did not introduce extra errors into the relationship between the land borders and the cadastre of either state. In parts, it improved the relationship between the South Australian cadastre and the SA/VIC state border.
This interim product will be updated when all states and territories have published agreed, authoritative representations of their land borders. This product will also be updated to include land mass polygons at time when the Coastline Capture Program is complete. This dataset is GDA 2020 compliant - transformed into GDA2020 from it's original source datum. Reference System Code 2020.00.

This publication is the fourth in an annual series that uses vehicle telematics data to provide measures of traffic congestion for freight vehicles for selected routes across Australia’s five mainland state capital cities—Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. The selected routes comprise the major motorways, highways and arterial roads within each city that service both passenger and freight vehicles. This release includes measures for 71 routes. The estimates presented in this report cover calendar year 2022, and include comparisons with 2021 traffic congestion levels.
This is the first year since the initial report, in 2019, where none of Australia’s capital cities experienced major lockdowns as part of the COVID-19 pandemic, and city-wide congestion levels have more or less returned to pre-pandemic levels. In particular, city-wide vehicle congestion, as measured by the mean excess time index, increased (worsened) in Sydney, Melbourne and, to a lesser extent, Adelaide between 2021 and 2022, but decreased (improved) in Brisbane and Perth. Many individual motorway routes exhibit increased congestion at morning and afternoon peaks in 2022, compared to 2020 and 2021. On some routes measured congestion is still lower than the pre-pandemic results in 2019. On other routes, congestion peaks exceed 2019 levels.

The Mineral Potential web service provides access to digital datasets used in the assessment of mineral potential in Australia. The service includes maps showing the potential for sediment-hosted base metal mineral systems in Australia.
This product shows the potential for sediment-hosted copper mineral systems in Australia (incorporating sediment-hosted stratiform copper and Mount Isa-type copper systems). This map is a synthesis of three component layers: sources of metals, energy drivers and lithospheric architecture, but excludes maps derived from geological datasets with incomplete coverage or inconsistent attribution. The maps are integrated using a knowledge-driven approach to produce the final mineral potential map for the mineral system.
Supporting datasets including the input maps used to generate the mineral potential maps, an assessment criteria table that contains information on the map creation, and data uncertainty maps are available here Uncertainty Maps. The data uncertainty values range between 0 and 1, with higher uncertainty values being located in areas where more input maps are missing data or have unknown values.

Saltmarsh are coastal wetlands that are regularly inundated with tidal sea water and consist of salt tolerant species of grasses and herbs. Saltmarshes are found in temperate, subtropical and some tropical climatic regions and provide coastal protection by stabilising sediments and reducing wave action. Saltmarsh provide important habitat for small fish and invertebrates as well as grounds for feeding and roosting by migratory birds.

The Liquid Fuel Terminals Database presents the spatial locations; in point format, all known liquid fuel terminals within Australia. For the purposes of this dataset a Liquid Fuel Terminal is defined as: A facility used for the storage of petroleum products.
Accuracy of the spatial data varies depending on the geographic location of the liquid fuel terminals and the accuracy of the imagery used to digitize the feature. Where required, Geoscience Australia staff sought clarification from online sources to validate information. Geoscience Australia used a Validation and Testing methodology to ensure the quality and compliance of the liquids fuel terminals dataset. Testing is carried out using a mixture of computer programs and proprietary GIS packages (such as ArcGIS). Many of the tests are automated, using customised computer programs. These are supported by a detailed on-screen visual inspection of the digital data against available imagery and reference material for logical consistency and attribute accuracy.
Where feature populations are small, or the validation tests are particularly important, the full population will be tested. Where feature populations are large, or a less stringent tolerance applies, a Statistical Subset or Sample (Area) test may be used. Statistical Subset tests are a random selection of features from the whole population, whereas Sample tests assess features within a selected geographical area. Statistically acceptable procedures are adopted for tests that require sampling. The sampling procedures adopted are based on the Australian Standard AS1199-1988: ""Sampling procedures and tables for inspection by attribute"". The Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) is in the range of 0% to 5% against a defined technical specification.
All effort has been made to capture all the liquid fuel terminals listed in the primary information sources (refer to Source Information).

Lineage statement
This dataset replaces the original first version of the data published on 1 January 2012; which did not include the recycling facilities.
This updated version of the data contains the recycling facilities. The waste management facilities dataset underwent a complete update in 2022 using waste data captured by the Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment (DAWE). The dataset was address matched using the address provided with the Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF) data. Where no spatial location was provided, GIS specialists attempted to find a corresponding GNAF address and updates to this address were completed where possible.
Visually located sites were found using Esri World Imagery and aligned to match a similar location on the block based on the surrounding GNAF address. For example center or front of block. Some locations were unable to be located due to lack of ground truthing capability. All other waste facilities contain the spatial and attribution originally received from DAWE. The imagery used ranges from one meter or better satellite and aerial sources.

Abstract
The Foundation Rail Infrastructure feature dataset is part of the Foundation Spatial Data Framework theme for Transport. This feature class represents a national aggregation of the spatial locations and attributes of point features, of publicly available data for Railway Stations. Rail Infrastructure information has been derived from various sources provided by data custodians including Spatial Services (NSW), Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy (QLD), Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (VIC), Land Tasmania (TAS) and Department of Infrastructure and Transport (SA).
The coverage is across all states and territories however due to restrictive licensing, Geoscience Australia data was used as the source data for Western Australia (lines and points), the Northern Territory (lines and points) and South Australia (points). Data published by Victoria falling within South Australia has been included (points).
Further information on datasets provided by State and Territory custodians can be found under Source Information in this metadata statement.

This dataset is a subset of Australian Geological Provinces 2018, 1:1 Million Scale and describes Archean to Proterozoic to Paleozoic large igneous provinces.
The Australian Geological Provinces Database contains descriptions and spatial extents of the fundamental geological elements of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
Province types include sedimentary basins, tectonic provinces such as cratons and orogens, igneous provinces, and metallogenic provinces.
Spatial data has been captured largely at approximately 1:1M scale for intended use between 1:2M and 1:5M scale. This edition (2018.01) of the dataset is NOT a complete representation of all of Australia's geological provinces.
Further work is required to complete the national geological province collection. Additionally, not all the provinces supplied herein have undergone a rigorous quality assurance (QA) check to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their descriptions.
Where possible, provinces have been attributed with their age, contained lithostratigraphic units, relationships to other provinces, geological history, mineral resource occurrences, and selected published references.
The geological definition of some provinces is contentious.
While every effort has been made to achieve a consensus interpretation of each province, including significant collaboration with state and territory geological surveys, scientific debate may still occur about the nature and extent of some provinces. The full 2D spatial extent (ie, including the extent of a province under any overlying cover material) of provinces has been captured.
Additionally, the extent of outcrop of some provinces has also been captured. Where possible, the full extent outlines of provinces have been attributed with information about the source, accuracy, and observation method of those lines.

Geoscience Australia catalog entry: Australian Geological Provinces 2018.01 edition
Lineage statement
The spatial data (polygons and lines) was compiled typically at or around 1:1 million scale from a wide range of published surface geology maps, bedrock or basement geology maps, borehole data, and geophysical imagery.
Where province boundaries crossed jurisdictional borders, Geoscience Australia worked with State and Territory geological agencies to achieve an agreed spatial extent.
Descriptive attribute data was compiled from authoritative published literature wherever possible, and names of these references are supplied with the data.
Not all the data in this edition of the dataset (2018.01) has undergone rigorous quality control.
All province descriptions in this edition of the dataset contain an indication of whether the data has been checked or not.

Lineage statement
Using the previous Emergency Management Facilities datasets (2018) acquired from State and Territory agencies, the data was uploaded into an ArcSDE environment using Feature Manipulation Engine (FME). The process included the extraction of the themed features, and the translation of the data into a schema created by the Built Environment & Exposure Section, National Location Information Branch, Geoscience Australia (GA). In 2023 further FME processing was completed where the dataset was address matched using the original address provided and compared with the Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF) data. If no address match occurred GIS specialists attempted to find a relevant corresponding G-NAF address to join to, where possible.

The Integrated Marine and Coastal Regionalisation of Australia (IMCRA v4.0) is a spatial framework for classifying Australia’s marine environment into bioregions that make sense ecologically and are at a scale useful for regional planning. This will be a framework for subsequent finer levels of planning and management. IMCRA v.4.0 is the product of the combination of the Interim Marine and Coastal Regionalisation of Australia (IMCRA v3.3), which provided a marine regionalisation of inshore waters, with the National Marine Bioregionalisation (NMB) for off-shelf waters. In combining the two national scale marine regionalisations, IMCRA v4.0 covers Australia’s waters from the coast to the edge of the Exclusive Economic Zone excluding Antarctica and Heard and Macdonald Islands.
Regionalisations provide spatial frameworks that have applications for many aspects of natural resource management. They are based on collated data and inferred patterns across a variety of spatial scales and are an accepted tool to assist in the description of ecosystem boundaries for planning and management in the natural environment. Marine regionalisations help managers to understand complex ecosystems and their specific management needs.
As a tool for organising spatial information, regionalisations are important for conservation, education, science, environmental inventories, delineation of biophysical distributions and the development of management policies and organisation of management activities.
The IMCRA v4.0 is used as the national and regional framework for Australia’s National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas (NRSMPA). Other applications include

decision-making (e.g. in assessing applications for permits);
identifying areas that have particular values  for conservation or use (e.g. Great Barrier Reef Marine Park);
finer-scale habitat mapping (e.g. Northwest Shelf Joint Environmental Study in 2002 and Great Barrier Reef Marine Park); and
fine scale bioregional assessments as part  of marine protected area planning.

There are 60 meso-scale regions on the continental shelf, defined using biological and physical information and geographic distance along the coast. Detailed descriptions of the mesoscale regions can be found in the report for IMCRA v3.3 (IMCRA Technical Group, 1998).

Lineage statement
IMCRA v4.0 mesoscale bioregions are based on IMCRA v3.3 with updates to the coastline, shelf break, a small boundary change in WA, and error corrections in NSW.
For IMCRA v3.3 two main approaches were used in integrating existing data received from State and Northern Territory marine conservation agencies:

Available regionalisation boundaries and descriptions were interpreted/integrated and transferred onto paper maps, and then these boundaries were digitised; and
Where local and sub-regional scale GIS datasets were available, these data/regions were aggregated to derive coarser meso-scale map unit boundaries using a combination of paper-based maps and GIS.

For IMCRA v4.0 the coastline was replaced with the national 100k coastline to provide greater consistency. The Australian EEZ limit was sourced from AMB v2.

This dataset is a subset of Australian Geological Provinces 2018, 1:1 Million Scale and describes the extents of Late Paleozoic sedimentary basins of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
The Australian Geological Provinces Database contains descriptions and spatial extents of the fundamental geological elements of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
Province types include sedimentary basins, tectonic provinces such as cratons and orogens, igneous provinces, and metallogenic provinces.
Spatial data has been captured largely at approximately 1:1M scale for intended use between 1:2M and 1:5M scale. This edition (2018.01) of the dataset is NOT a complete representation of all of Australia's geological provinces.
Further work is required to complete the national geological province collection. Additionally, not all the provinces supplied herein have undergone a rigorous quality assurance (QA) check to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their descriptions.
Where possible, provinces have been attributed with their age, contained lithostratigraphic units, relationships to other provinces, geological history, mineral resource occurrences, and selected published references.
The geological definition of some provinces is contentious.
While every effort has been made to achieve a consensus interpretation of each province, including significant collaboration with state and territory geological surveys, scientific debate may still occur about the nature and extent of some provinces. The full 2D spatial extent (ie, including the extent of a province under any overlying cover material) of provinces has been captured.
Additionally, the extent of outcrop of some provinces has also been captured. Where possible, the full extent outlines of provinces have been attributed with information about the source, accuracy, and observation method of those lines.

The Mineral Potential web service provides access to digital datasets used in the assessment of mineral potential in Australia. The service includes maps showing the potential for sediment-hosted base metal mineral systems in Australia.
This product shows the potential for Irish-Type Zn-Pb (Irish) mineral systems in Australia. This map is a synthesis of four component layers: sources of metals, energy drivers, lithospheric architecture, and depositional gradients, using a weighted sum to produce the final mineral potential map for the mineral system.
Supporting datasets including the input maps used to generate the mineral potential maps, an assessment criteria table that contains information on the map creation, and data uncertainty maps are available here Uncertainty Maps. The data uncertainty values range between 0 and 1, with higher uncertainty values being located in areas where more input maps are missing data or have unknown values.

Lineage Statement
Product Created 20 December 2022
Product Published 13 March 2023
A large number of published datasets were individually transformed to summarise our current understanding of the spatial extents of key mineral system mappable criteria. These individual layers were integrated using weightings within a mineral system component framework to produce national-scale mineral potential assessments for Australian
sediment-hosted base metal mineral systems.
Update August 2023:
· Addition of sediment-hosted Cu mineral potential maps and corresponding uncertainty maps
· Addition of input maps for sediment-hosted Cu mineral potential
· Addition of input maps for sediment-hosted Zn-Pb mineral potential
· Update to assessment criteria table with information on sediment-hosted Cu mineral system
· Update to metadata statement for data

This dataset is a subset of Australian Geological Provinces 2018, 1:1 Million Scale and describes the extents of Mesozoic sedimentary basins of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
The Australian Geological Provinces Database contains descriptions and spatial extents of the fundamental geological elements of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
Province types include sedimentary basins, tectonic provinces such as cratons and orogens, igneous provinces, and metallogenic provinces.
Spatial data has been captured largely at approximately 1:1M scale for intended use between 1:2M and 1:5M scale. This edition (2018.01) of the dataset is NOT a complete representation of all of Australia's geological provinces.
Further work is required to complete the national geological province collection. Additionally, not all the provinces supplied herein have undergone a rigorous quality assurance (QA) check to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their descriptions.
Where possible, provinces have been attributed with their age, contained lithostratigraphic units, relationships to other provinces, geological history, mineral resource occurrences, and selected published references.
The geological definition of some provinces is contentious.
While every effort has been made to achieve a consensus interpretation of each province, including significant collaboration with state and territory geological surveys, scientific debate may still occur about the nature and extent of some provinces. The full 2D spatial extent (ie, including the extent of a province under any overlying cover material) of provinces has been captured.
Additionally, the extent of outcrop of some provinces has also been captured. Where possible, the full extent outlines of provinces have been attributed with information about the source, accuracy, and observation method of those lines.

Lineage statement
The spatial data (polygons and lines) was compiled typically at or around 1:1 million scale from a wide range of published surface geology maps, bedrock or basement geology maps, borehole data, and geophysical imagery.
Where province boundaries crossed jurisdictional borders, Geoscience Australia worked with State and Territory geological agencies to achieve an agreed spatial extent.
Descriptive attribute data was compiled from authoritative published literature wherever possible, and names of these references are supplied with the data.
Not all the data in this edition of the dataset (2018.01) has undergone rigorous quality control.
All province descriptions in this edition of the dataset contain an indication of whether the data has been checked or not.

Source Information
The project team initially identified a list of potential source data through jurisdictional websites and the Emergency Management LINK catalogue. These were then confirmed by each jurisdiction through the EMSINA National and EMSINA Developers networks.
This Webservice contains authoritative data sourced from:

Australian Capital Territory - Emergency Service Agency (ESA)
New South Wales - Rural Fire Service (RFS)
Queensland - Queensland Fire and Emergency Service (QFES)
South Australia - Country Fire Service (CFS)
Tasmania - Tasmania Fire Service (TFS)
Victoria – Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP)
Western Australia – Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES)

The completeness of the data within this webservice is reliant on each jurisdictional source and the information they elect to publish into their Operational Bushfire Boundary webservices.
Known Limitations:

This dataset does not contain information from the Northern Territory government.
This dataset contains a subset of the Queensland bushfire boundary data. The Queensland ‘Operational’ feed that is consumed within this National Database displays a the last six (6) months of incident boundaries. In order to make this dataset best represent a ‘near-real-time’ or current view of operational bushfire boundaries Geoscience Australia has filtered the Queensland data to only incorporate the last two (2) weeks data.
Geoscience Australia is aware of duplicate data (features) may appear within this dataset. This duplicate data is commonly represented in the regions around state borders where it is operationally necessary for one jurisdiction to understand cross border situations. Care must be taken when summing the values to obtain a total area burnt.
The data within this aggregated National product is a spatial representation of the input data received from the custodian agencies.  Therefore, data quality and data completion will vary.  If you wish to assess more information about specific jurisdictional data and/or data feature(s) it is strongly recommended that you contact the appropriate custodian.

The accuracy of the data attributes within this webservice is reliant on each jurisdictional source and the information they elect to publish into their Operational Bushfire Boundary webservices.
Note: Geoscience Australia has, where possible, attempted to align the data to the (as of October 2023) draft National Current Incident Extent Feeds Data Dictionary. However, this has not been possible in all cases. Work to progress this alignment will be undertaken after the publication of this dataset, once this project enters a maintenance period.

Lineage Statement
Version 1 and 2 (2019/20):
This dataset was first built by EMSINA, Geoscience Australia, and Esri Australia staff in early January 2020 in response to the Black Summer Bushfires. The product was aimed at providing a nationally consistent dataset of bushfire boundaries. Version 1 was released publicly on 8 January 2020 through Esri AGOL software.
Version 2 of the product was released in mid-February as EMSINA and Geoscience Australia began automating the product. The release of version 2 exhibited a reformatted attributed table to accommodate these new automation scripts.
The product was continuously developed by the three entities above until early May 2020 when both the scripts and data were handed over to the National Bushfire Recovery Agency. The EMSINA Group formally ended their technical involvement with this project on June 30, 2020.
Version 3 (2020/21):
A 2020/21 version of the National Operational Bushfire Boundaries dataset was agreed to by the Australian Government. It continued to extend upon EMSINA’s 2019/20 Version 2 product. This product was owned and managed by the Australian Government Department of Home Affairs, with Geoscience Australia identified as the technical partners responsible for development and delivery.
Work on Version 3 began in August 2020 with delivery of this product occurring on 14 September 2020.
Version 4 (2021/22):
A 2021/22 version of the National Operational Bushfire Boundaries dataset was produced by Geoscience Australia. This product was owned and managed by Geoscience Australia, who provided both development and delivery.
Work on Version 4 began in August 2021 with delivery of this product occurring on 1 September 2021. The dataset was discontinued in May 2022 because of insufficient Government funding.
Version 5 (2023/25):
A 2023/25 version of the National Near-Real-Time Bushfire Boundaries dataset is produced by Geoscience Australia under funding from the National Bushfire Intelligence Capability (NBIC) - CSIRO.  NBIC and Geoscience Australia have also partnered with the EMSINA Group to assist with accessing and delivering this dataset. This dataset is the first time where the jurisdictional attributes are aligned to AFAC’s National Bushfire Schema.
Work on Version 5 began in August 2023 and was released in late 2023 under formal access arrangements with the States and Territories.

Surface Geology of Australia - Miscellaneous Lines contains lines that complement the geology data, but are not classified as geological features (eg, coastline and other water boundaries).
The 1:2.5M scale geology of Australia data documents the distribution and age of major stratigraphic, intrusive and medium to high-grade metamorphic rock units of onshore Australia.
This edition contains the same geological content as previous editions (1998 to 2010), but is structured according to Geoscience Australia's 2012 data standards.
The dataset was compiled to use at scales between 1:2,500,000 and 1:5,000,000 inclusive.
The units distinguished/mapped mainly represent stratigraphic supergroups, regional intrusive associations and regional metamorphic complexes.
Groupings of Precambrian units in the time-space diagram are generally separated by major time breaks; Phanerozoic units are grouped according to stratigraphic age i.e. System/Period.
The time-space diagram has the added benefit that it provides a summary of units currently included on the themes.
The method used to distinguish sedimentary and many volcanic units varies for each geological eon as follows:

Cenozoic units are morphological units which emphasise the relationship of the sedimentary fill to the landscape;
Mesozoic units are regionally extensive to continent-wide time-rock units which emphasise the System of Period(s);
Paleozoic units are stratotectonic units that emphasise either the dominant System or Period(s) or the range of Periods;
Proterozoic units are commonly regional stratotectonic units - separated by major time breaks and split into the Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic Eras - which are generally unique to each cratonic region; and
Archean units are regional lithological units grouped into broad time divisions.

Metamorphic units are lithological units which emphasise the metamorphic facies and timing of the last major metamorphic event.
Igneous units are regional units which emphasise the dominant lithology and are grouped into broad time divisions.

Geoscience Australia catalog entry: Surface Geology of Australia 1:2.5 million scale dataset 2012 edition
Lineage statement
The geological content of the 2012 edition of the 1:2.5M surface geology of Australia is the same as the previous 2010 edition (ANZLIC dataset ID = ANZCW0703013817), restructured to comply with 2012 Geoscience Australia and international data standards.
The original data was compiled from digital data, mainly at 1:2 500 000 scale, supplied by AGSO, GSWA, NTGS, PIRSA, GSQ, GSTAS, GSNSW and GSVIC and from data obtained from many other groups.
In order to synthesise data from a variety of sources into a coherent product, the degree and nature of modification of the source data varied from case to case.
Cenozoic and Mesozoic units were derived from sources, including the Cenozoic Paleogeographic Atlas of Australia (Landford et al., 1995), the Geology of Australia 1986 and a compilation of Cenozoic basins in the Alice Springs region by B.R. Senior et al. (AGSO Record 1994/66).
The Phanerozoic units of southeastern Australia are substantially a modification of the 1:2 500 000 scale map entitled ""Stratotectonic and Structural Elements of the Tasman Fold Belt System"".
The geology of Tasmania is a generalisation of data assembled as part of the TASGO project (a GSTAS and AGSO/AGCRC venture completed in 1997).
The geology of South Australia is a highly generalised modification of the 1993 1:2 000 000 scale Geological Map of South Australia.
For the Precambrian compilation, much of the geology of Western Australia has been derived from the Geological Map of Western Australia, 1988 with some modifications.
The geology of the Kimberley, Halls Creek, Tanami and Arunta regions has been updated in line with recent mapping and some input from magnetic interpretation to emphasise relationships with the Tanami region.
The geology of the Amadeus region has been generalised from the 1:1 000 000 scale ""Structural Map of the Amadeus Basin"" (Compiler A.J. Stewart).
The geology of the Musgrave region has been re-compiled and simplified.
The geology of North Queensland has been generalised by D. Palfreyman and D. Pillinger from the ""North Qld Geology, 1997"" 1:1 000 000 scale map (compilers J.H.C. Bain & D. Haipola).

This dataset is a subset of Australian Geological Provinces 2018, 1:1 Million Scale and describes the extents of Paleozoic to Mesozoic sedimentary basins of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
The Australian Geological Provinces Database contains descriptions and spatial extents of the fundamental geological elements of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
Province types include sedimentary basins, tectonic provinces such as cratons and orogens, igneous provinces, and metallogenic provinces.
Spatial data has been captured largely at approximately 1:1M scale for intended use between 1:2M and 1:5M scale. This edition (2018.01) of the dataset is NOT a complete representation of all of Australia's geological provinces.
Further work is required to complete the national geological province collection. Additionally, not all the provinces supplied herein have undergone a rigorous quality assurance (QA) check to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their descriptions.
Where possible, provinces have been attributed with their age, contained lithostratigraphic units, relationships to other provinces, geological history, mineral resource occurrences, and selected published references.
The geological definition of some provinces is contentious.
While every effort has been made to achieve a consensus interpretation of each province, including significant collaboration with state and territory geological surveys, scientific debate may still occur about the nature and extent of some provinces. The full 2D spatial extent (ie, including the extent of a province under any overlying cover material) of provinces has been captured.
Additionally, the extent of outcrop of some provinces has also been captured. Where possible, the full extent outlines of provinces have been attributed with information about the source, accuracy, and observation method of those lines.

This national harmonised dataset uses daily updates from State and Territory roadworks endpoints (APIs) to build a nationally consistent, harmonised historic database of roadworks and road closures over time across all of Australia. Daily updates from state/territory roadworks systems are queried to compile a set of historical and planned roadworks for all of Australia. The geospatial coverage of the dataset is all state-managed roads in Australia. Most jurisdictions include planned and unplanned works and closures, however data for Tasmania currently includes planned roadworks only. There are roadworks and road closures prior to 2016 but the dates may not be correct. Roadworks and road closures currently in progress may have an end date years into the future - the date predicted when roadworks or road closure will be complete.
This data set could be used to understand (and potentially predict and manage) road damage and road closures and improve resilience in the context of natural disasters or disruptions.

Lineage Statement
The Harmonised National Roadworks and Road Closures dataset uses daily updates from state/territory roadworks systems to compile a set of historical roadworks for all of Australia. The geospatial coverage of the dataset is all state-managed roads in Australia. Most jurisdictions include planned and unplanned works and closures, however data for Tasmania currently includes planned roadworks only.
Each state/territory uses a different set of roadwork 'types' to classify the works. The harmonisation process groups like types into a set of categories which are consistent across all jurisdictions, for reporting and visualisation purposes. Where the data indicates the road is closed (via text description), a category of Road Closure is applied, irrespective of the state/territory 'type'.

The National Land Cover Account was produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and released in alignment with the Commonwealth government's Common national approach to environmental-economic accounting in Australia. Experimental estimates published in the Land Cover Account were developed in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (now Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water) and Geoscience Australia (GA), including GA's internal research area: Digital Earth Australia (DEA).

Further information on the National Land Cover Account methodology can be found here.

Data considerations
The input data was not collected or validated at SA2 level. Classes with small estimates are less reliable and should be used with caution. Any discrepancies between totals and sums of components in this publication are due to rounding.

Zeros can be real zeros (or rounded to zero), or data that is not available.

SA2s that cover Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island are not in scope of the account and these SA2s have not been included in the data.

This dataset is a subset of Surface Geology of Australia 2012, 1:1M Scale symbolised by lithography classification.
The Surface Geology of Australia 1:1M scale dataset (2012 edition) is a seamless national coverage of outcrop and surficial geology, compiled for use at or around 1:1 million scale.
The data maps outcropping bedrock geology and unconsolidated or poorly consolidated regolith material covering bedrock.
Geological units are represented as polygon and line geometries, and are attributed with information regarding stratigraphic nomenclature and hierarchy, age, lithology, and primary data source.
The dataset also contains geological contacts, structural features such as faults and shears, and miscellaneous supporting lines like the boundaries of water and ice bodies.
The 2012 dataset has been updated from the previous 2010 data by updating geological unit data to 2012 information in the Australian Stratigraphic Units Database, incorporating new published mapping in the Northern Territory and Queensland, and correcting errors or inconsistent data identified in the previous edition, particularly in the Phanerozoic geology of Western Australia.
The attribute structure of the dataset has also been revised to be more compatible with the GeoSciML data standard, published by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information.
The first edition of this national dataset was first released in 2008, with map data compiled largely from simplifying and edgematching existing 1:250 000 scale geological maps.
Where these maps were not current, more recent source maps ranging in scale from 1:50 000 to 1:1 million were used.
In some areas where the only available geological maps were old and poorly located, some repositioning of mapping using recent satellite imagery or geophysics was employed.

For the purposes of this dataset,
Tram or Tramline is defined as: a transportation system using one or more rails to carry freight or passengers that has been defined in the source data as a tramway or light rail subtype and/or as having a ‘light’ gauge in the gauge attribute.
Abstract
The Foundation Rail Infrastructure feature dataset is part of the Foundation Spatial Data Framework theme for Transport. The Foundation Rail Infrastructure feature dataset is specifically made up of Rail line features (Railways, Rail Sidings and Tramline including Light Rail) and Rail points (Stations). This feature class represents a national aggregation of the spatial locations and attributes of line and point features, of publicly available data. Rail Infrastructure information has been derived from various sources provided by data custodians including Spatial Services (NSW), Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy (QLD), Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (VIC), Land Tasmania (TAS) and Department of Infrastructure and Transport (SA).
The coverage is across all states and territories however due to restrictive licensing, Geoscience Australia data was used as the source data for Western Australia (lines and points), the Northern Territory (lines and points) and South Australia (points). Data published by Victoria falling within South Australia has been included (points).
Further information on datasets provided by State and Territory custodians can be found under Source Information in this metadata statement.

This dataset is a subset of Australian Geological Provinces 2018, 1:1 Million Scale and describes the extents of Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic sedimentary basins of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
The Australian Geological Provinces Database contains descriptions and spatial extents of the fundamental geological elements of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
Province types include sedimentary basins, tectonic provinces such as cratons and orogens, igneous provinces, and metallogenic provinces.
Spatial data has been captured largely at approximately 1:1M scale for intended use between 1:2M and 1:5M scale. This edition (2018.01) of the dataset is NOT a complete representation of all of Australia's geological provinces.
Further work is required to complete the national geological province collection. Additionally, not all the provinces supplied herein have undergone a rigorous quality assurance (QA) check to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their descriptions.
Where possible, provinces have been attributed with their age, contained lithostratigraphic units, relationships to other provinces, geological history, mineral resource occurrences, and selected published references.
The geological definition of some provinces is contentious.
While every effort has been made to achieve a consensus interpretation of each province, including significant collaboration with state and territory geological surveys, scientific debate may still occur about the nature and extent of some provinces. The full 2D spatial extent (ie, including the extent of a province under any overlying cover material) of provinces has been captured.
Additionally, the extent of outcrop of some provinces has also been captured. Where possible, the full extent outlines of provinces have been attributed with information about the source, accuracy, and observation method of those lines.

Lineage statement
Using the previous Emergency Management Facilities datasets (2018) acquired from State and Territory agencies, the data was uploaded into an ArcSDE environment using Feature Manipulation Engine (FME). The process included the extraction of the themed features, and the translation of the data into a schema created by the Built Environment & Exposure Section, National Location Information Branch, Geoscience Australia (GA). In 2023 further FME processing was completed where the dataset was address matched using the original address provided and compared with the Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF) data. If no address match occurred GIS specialists attempted to find a relevant corresponding G-NAF address to join to, where possible.

Mangrove extent is presented in the data as hectares.

This dataset includes 2016 and 2021 Mangrove extent information that was derived from the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Mangrove Canopy Cover (Landsat) product. This product consists of a sequence (one per year) of 30m resolution maps that are generated by analysing the Landsat fractional cover developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program and the Global Mangrove Watch layers developed by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency.

Mangrove extent accounts have been created using Geoscience Australia’s DEA Mangrove Cover Product (Geoscience Australia 2022) at the source 30m resolution. The data provides detail on extent of mangroves as per the cover classes shown in table 4. The extent accounts have been compiled using the same methodology as was used to compile the National Land Account, see here for further details; National Land Account, Experimental Estimates methodology, 2016.

The Mineral Potential web service provides access to digital datasets used in the assessment of mineral potential in Australia. The service includes maps showing the potential for sediment-hosted base metal mineral systems in Australia.
This product shows the potential for sediment-hosted copper mineral systems in Australia (incorporating sediment-hosted stratiform copper and Mount Isa-type copper systems). This map is a synthesis of four component layers: sources of metals, energy drivers, lithospheric architecture, and ore depositional gradients. The maps are integrated using a knowledge-driven approach to produce the final mineral potential map for the mineral system.
Supporting datasets including the input maps used to generate the mineral potential maps, an assessment criteria table that contains information on the map creation, and data uncertainty maps are available here Uncertainty Maps. The data uncertainty values range between 0 and 1, with higher uncertainty values being located in areas where more input maps are missing data or have unknown values.

Lineage statement
The Harmonised National Roadworks and Road Closures dataset uses daily updates from state/territory roadworks systems to compile a set of historical roadworks for all of Australia. The geospatial coverage of the dataset is all state-managed roads in Australia. Most jurisdictions include planned and unplanned works and closures, however data for Tasmania currently includes planned roadworks only. The data commences from 2016 - some earlier records are present but the dates do not appear to be accurate.
Each state/territory uses a different set of roadwork 'types' to classify the works. The harmonisation process groups like types into a set of categories which are consistent across all jurisdictions, for reporting and visualisation purposes. Where the data indicates the road is closed (via text description), a category of Road Closure is applied, irrespective of the state/territory 'type'.

This application is designed primarily for desktop view. Mobile view may be made available in the future with reduced functionality. More information on data and statistics Disclaimer To protect the privacy of Australians, certain data has been modified by authorised entities, in compliance with privacy regulations. Due to this, statistics here should be taken as a guide to inform understanding, please assume a small margin of error when using the app. Data limitations • Areas with small populations (under 500), the data may have a higher margin of error. This is because minor inaccuracies can have a bigger impact in these areas. • In some cases, data may appear to be missing. This is where there is a 'Null' value meaning this information is unavailable for this area. • Total Unemployment Payment recipients are calculated by summing already rounded data, this may result in minor inaccuracies. • The application uses the most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics population data available at the time of publication. The differing data dates may cause discrepancies in the calculation of proportional statistics (e.g., a high proportion of Income Support receipt where there has been extensive population growth between 2021 (when the census was collected) and the reported income support data date). Statistical Area Level 2 boundaries Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2s) are areas designed to represent a community that interacts together socially and economically. SA2s are updated every census to reflect current communities and follow suburb or local government areas where appropriate. SA2s are a common standard for understanding and representing population data. Learn more about SA2s. Unemployment payment data An unemployment payment refers to JobSeeker Payment (previously Newstart Allowance) and Youth Allowance (other), which are income support payments made to a recipient that helps with living costs, while they look for work. The income support payment data in this application is published by DSS and represents the number of unique recipients of each payment as at the last Friday of the reported month. To protect individuals’ privacy, all values have been rounded to the nearest 5, values from 1 to 7 are rounded to 5. Zero cells are actual zeros. For older periods, figures between 1-4 were randomly assigned a 0 or a 5. Note: reporting rules and policy settings have changed over time, the data in this application has been updated to align over the reported period. Data for periods prior to 2023 may not align with data previously published. See the DSS data on data.gov.au: DSS Benefit and Payment Recipient Demographics - quarterly data | data.gov.au.

SEIFA score The Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) summarises areas according to their relative socio-economic advantage and disadvantage then ranks them. The ""IRSAD (percentile)"" index used here shows where an area stands nationally in terms of disadvantage or advantage. Lower numbers indicate more disadvantage and higher numbers indicate more advantage. It's presented as a percentile to make it easier to understand the ranking. For example, an area with an IRSAD (percentile) of 5 is in the top 5% of disadvantaged areas in the country.

This raster dataset provides the latest summary information on Australia's present (extant) native vegetation, which has been classified into Major Vegetation Groups. It is in Albers Equal Area projection with a 100 m x 100 m (1 Ha) cell size. A comparable Pre-1750 (pre-European, pre-clearing) raster dataset is available.
For this update, Version 6.0, the extant datasets for Queensland, Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and Western Australia have been updated. An automated, data-driven procedure, followed by thorough manual checks, was undertaken to make any necessary updates to MVG/MVS assignments for WA, VIC, NT, SA and NSW, with any changes being verified by the corresponding state/territory contacts.
For Version 5.1 the extant dataset for Tasmania was updated, with gapfilling work being completed for the NSW extant dataset. Some of the rulesets underpinning the assignment of MVGs and MVSs were also updated to improve consistency for their allocation.
Version 5.0 substantially standardised the lookup tables (NVIS5_0_LUT_DETAILxxxx and NVIS5_0_LUT_AUST_FLATxxxx). Previously, Version 4.2 updated NSW. For version 4.1 most agencies supplied data to the update. For more detail refer to the associate lookup tables.
Summaries were derived from the best available data in the NVIS extant theme. This product is derived from a compilation of data collected at different scales on different dates by different organisations. Please refer to the separate Key Dataset map showing scales of the input datasets 'NVIS6_0_KEY_DSET_xxx'.
Gaps in the NVIS database were filled by non-NVIS data, notably parts of South Australia and small areas of New South Wales such as the Curlewis area. The data represent on-ground dates of up to 2006 in Queensland, 2001 to 2005 in South Australia (depending on the region) and 2004/5 in other jurisdictions, except NSW. NVIS data was partially updated in NSW with 2001-09 data, with extensive areas of 1997 data remaining from the earlier version of NVIS.
Major Vegetation Groups were identified to summarise the type and distribution of Australia's native vegetation. The classification contains different mixes of plant species within the canopy, shrub or ground layers, but are structurally similar and are often dominated by a single genus. In a mapping sense, the groups reflect the dominant vegetation occurring in a map unit where there are a mix of several vegetation types. Subdominant vegetation groups which may also be present in the map unit are not shown. For example, the dominant vegetation in an area may be mapped as dominated by eucalypt open forest, although it contains pockets of rainforest, shrubland and grassland vegetation as subdominants.
A number of other non-vegetation and non-native vegetation land cover types are also represented as Major Vegetation Groups. These are provided for cartographic purposes, but should not be used for analyses.
The (related) Major Vegetation Subgroups represent the dominant vegetation groups in the dominant stratum, along with the dominant shrub or ground layer,and are available as separate raster datasets.

Lineage statement
NVIS Version 6.0
Spatial datasets were updated for Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland and Australian Capital Territory. Non-spatial updates have been made to all these states except WA, due to problems encountered with non-aligning mosaicked Map Units between the NVIS database and the non-spatial data supplied on the WA government portal. Hence, the original non-spatial data has been used in conjunction with the new spatial data for this state. For Queensland, updates were made predominantly to the MVG/MVS allocation as supplied directly by the state, with the existing Level 6 to Level 1 heirarchy mostly remaining unchanged from the existing database. However, a total of 567 L6 to L1 descriptions were updated in accordance with the Regional Ecosystem technical descriptions on the Qld Government portal. For the remaining states and territories the Version 5.1 spatial and non-spatial data was reused.
The VICTA tool (an automated, data-driven procedure with embedded rulesets) was run to make any necessary updates to MVG/MVS assignments for WA, VIC, NT, SA and NSW, followed by necessary manual QA checks. This resulted in some changes to L6 and L5 descriptions. Any changes made to the existing L5/L6 descriptions were verified by the corresponding state/territory contacts.

A regionalisation of Australian waters (excluding waters adjacent to the Territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands, and waters adjacent to the Australian Antarctic Territory) derived from deep-water demersal fish assemblages. A total of 41 onshelf and offshelf provincial bioregions were identified for Integrated Marine and Coastal Regionalisation of Australia (IMCRA) v4.0.
Onshelf provincial bioregions are based on the 17 IMCRA v3.3 demersal provinces and biotones identified in 1997.
Offshelf provincial bioregions were defined in 2004 as part of a program run by Geoscience Australia, CSIRO Marine Research and the National Oceans Office. They represent units that contain broad patterns in biodiversity, as represented by deep-water demersal fish assemblages, based on the assumption that the demersal fish distributions are a surrogate of marine faunal distributions. Below 2,000 m water depth, the boundaries of the benthic provincial bioregions are defined solely by the National Marine Bioregionalisation (NMB) geomorphic features dataset. A total of 24 offshelf benthic provincial bioregions were defined on this basis, including 15 core bioregions representing areas of endemism, and 9 transition zones representing areas of faunal mixing.
For IMCRA v4.0 the coastline was replaced with the national 100k coastline to provide greater consistency. The Australian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) limit was sourced from Australian Maritime Boundaries (AMB) v2. Based on a decision by the Bioregionalisation Working Group, the shelf break from IMCRA v3.3 was largely retained, although in some instances the shelf break from the NMB provincial bioregions was used.
Continental slope provinces have been extended to the edge of the EEZ using either geomorphological features or the line of least distance in areas where there were no distinguishing seafloor features.
Core provinces are centres of demersal fish endemicity.
Transitions are regions of overlap between core provinces.
CAVEATS

Provincial boundaries below 1200m are based on geomorphological surrogates in the absence of biological data for deep waters.
Shelf and slope provinces have been defined in separate analyses.

Lineage statement
The benthic Provincial Bioregions were defined in 2004 as part of a program run by Geoscience Australia, CSIRO Marine Research and the National Oceans Office to create a spatial inventory of large-scale benthic biogeographical regions for Australia's EEZ. The Provincial Bioregions were defined by the regional structure in demersal fishes as represented by a one-dimensional made up of 281 nodes that correspond to the 500 m isobath around the Australian mainland. The analysis of the demersal fish data was undertaken by CSIRO Marine Research (Last et al., 2004). None of the offshore island territories were included in this assessment and each island territory was considered a separate bioregion. The boundaries of the Provincial Bioregions below 2,000 m water depth were defined solely by the geomorphic features, which were defined by the International Hydrographic Office (IHO, 2002), and were identified using a 250 m spatial resolution bathymetry model with reference to previously published geological studies. In the analysis of the demersal fish data, the boundaries between the Provincial Bioregions were defined by a Jaccard Analysis of the distributions. The final boundaries were drawn by eye around the boundaries of geomorphic features by a panel of scientific experts at a series of workshops with reference to previous studies. When completed, the boundaries defined the separate polygons and they were stored as an ArcGIS shapefile. Care was taken to include as much biological information as possible when positioning the boundaries, particularly in shallow water (500 m).

Natural Resource Management (NRM) Region boundaries and those NRM Region boundaries making up Regional Delivery Partner (RDP) management units, previously described as National Landcare Program (NLP) management units. Of these RDP management units those that overlap Remote Indigenous Procurement Policy (RIPP) areas by more than 50% are also identified as remote RDPs.
The NRM Regions dataset is maintained for the purpose of authoritative reporting on the Australian Government's NRM investments. The dataset is designed to cover all Australian territory where Australian Government funded NRM projects might take place and includes major islands, external territories, and state and coastal waters in addition to the NRM regional boundaries.
Whilst the boundaries of NRM Regions are defined by legislation in some states and territories, this dataset should not be used to represent legal boundaries in any way. It is an administrative dataset developed for the purpose of reporting and public information. It should be noted that from time to time the states and/or territories may revise their regional boundaries in accordance with local needs and therefore alterations to either the attribution or boundaries of the data may occur in the future.
Current Version
As part of Phase Two of the NLP the Australian Government's NRM investments will be delivered with RDPs across 56 management units. These replace the previous NLP management units used in NLP Phase One. They are officially referred to as 'Regional Delivery Partners for Environmental Protection, Sustainable Agriculture and Natural Resource Management Services 2022'. The spatial data for RDP management units are derived from the NRM Regions spatial data, as described below.
The 2022 dataset defines NRM Region boundaries and RDP management units in a single dataset, thereby overcoming version control issues with the previous approach of publishing separate data layers for each.
To handle a variety of required derivations, a fundamental set of 64 NRM Region map objects was first defined. This can then be compiled using various queries on non-spatial attributes. For example, as set out below, we can define 56 continental NRM Regions and 8 off-shore NRM regions, or island sub components of NRM regions located on the continent. Across these a total of 56 RDP management units can also be defined.
To identify those NRM regions located on the Australian continent, a ""continental"" field (yes/no) has been included, for the first time, in the 2022 dataset. It allows differentiation between off-shore and continental regions, and accommodates that some NRM regions (ie one each in NSW and Tasmania) have both a continental part (eg North Coast, NSW) and an off-shore part (eg North Coast - Lord Howe Island).
In accordance with the Australian Government’s Remote Indigenous Procurement Policy (RIPP) and its application to NRM regional investment, we have identified 16 RDP management units with more than 50% overlap with RIPP areas, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). A RIPP field (yes/no) is included in the attribute table.
The data structure allows either NRM Regions, RDP management units and those RDPs overlapping RIPPs to be mapped from the single dataset using the NRM_REGION, RDP_NAME and RIPP fields respectively. NRM_ID, RDP_ID and RIPP fields may also be used.
The 2022 version updates the previous version (2020). In total, the 2022 version dataset comprises 64 NRM map objects for 62 NRM regions. These comprise 56 mainland regions (of which two have associated islands as separate map objects), the Torres Strait NRM region, and a further five external territories. Four of these external territories are islands and one is classified as Marine NRM.
Using the RDP_NAME or RDP_ID fields to map Regional Delivery Partner management units will result in 56 RDP management units.
These comprise: 54 mainland RDP management units (two of which have island components); Torres Strait; and a ""Marine NRM"" management unit. The Marine NRM unit combines Australia's Territorial Sea (from 3 nautical miles to 12 nautical miles) and Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (to 200 nautical miles) as well as Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, Cocos Keeling Islands and Heard and McDonald Islands. It excludes coastal waters (to 3 nautical miles) which are part of the terrestrial RDP management units. It also excludes the Australian Antarctic Territory and Norfolk Island.
The 2022 version was derived from the former NRM regions series (latest version was 2020), originally established in 2006 as the ""Natural Heritage Trust II (NHT2) Region Boundaries"" dataset. Changes to the 2020 version in creating the 2022 version include the following:

Lineage statement
Original NHT layer Data was supplied from state GIS data for:

NSW - Catchment Management Authority Areas
QLD - Queensland NRM Regional Boundaries
SA - NRM Regions
TAS - Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment NRM Regions
VIC - Catchment Management Board Boundaries
WA - NRM Regions of Western Australia
NT - 1:100 000 State Border and Coastline
ACT - 1:100 000 State Border

The data supplied for TAS and WA was supplied in shapefile format with Qld, NSW, VIC data supplied in ArcInfo Export format. As there is only one NRM region for NT, this was derived from the coverage 1:100 000 Coastlines and State Borders.
All source coverages were projected to Geographics, and consistent attribution was applied. All source coverages were appended, and the result cleaned with 0.0001 tolerances. On inspection of the state data it was noted that the borders and coastlines used were different amongst those datasets supplied by states and territories. The 1:100 000 Geoscience Australia (formerly AUSLIG) state borders and coastline were appended to the coverage in an effort to standardise the series at a national level. Slither polygons along common boundaries were eliminated, and a final check of attribution conducted.
In Februrary 2004, new NSW NRM regions (CMA boundaries) were supplied to DEH. The existing NSW regions were replaced by the new boundaries, which are largely amalgamations of the existing regions (the number of NSW regions was reduced from 20 to 13), however there were also a number of minor boundary changes. The 1:100 000 Coastlines and State border was retained and only internal boundaries updated. In addition to the new NSW boundaries, a number of changes were also made.

Minor updates were made to VIC, SA, WA and Qld region names
Attributional corrections made to some islands and regions
Islands in Bass Strait were assigned to Vic or Tas as according to the Aus100k dataset
Some islands in Bass Strait containing sliver polygons corrected
New numeric code assigned to each region

February 2005

Torres Strait boundary updated as per the Bilateral Agreement. Was derived from the latest GBRMP boundary (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, July 1 2004), the Australia/Papua New Guinea border (Australian Maritime Boundaries Information System, Geoscience Australia 2001), the boundary of Australian territorial waters (Australian Maritime Boundaries Information System, Geoscience Australia 2001), the 11 degrees south latitude and the coastline of the mainland (Geoscience Australia 1:100000 coastline). These changes also resulted in an altered Cape York region boundary.
The Qld marine zones were changed to the 3nm limit (Australian Maritime Boundaries Information System, Geoscience Australia 2001), as well as some minor changes to internal region boundaries supplied by QLD State
Marine zones to the 3nm limit (Australian Maritime Boundaries Information System, Geoscience Australia 2001) were added to Tasmania. The marine zone was divided amongst the regions by extending the region boundaries beyond the coastline in the same direction. The boundary between South and North West was determined by locating the mid-point of the harbour (derived using a series of buffers).
Macquarie Island and corresponding 3nm limit was added to South NRM region in Tasmania (Geoscience Australia 1:100000 coastline and Australian Maritime Boundaries Information System, Geoscience Australia 2001)
An incorrectly labelled polygon was corrected from terrestrial to marine in Northern Gulf.
The border between East Gippsland and North East (VIC) was updated using data supplied by the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment.
The dataset was integrated to the Geoscience Australia 1:100000 coastline with a cluster tolerance of 0.00005 degrees. The resulting NRM dataset aligns exactly with the coastline.

August 2005
New NRM boundaries were provided by the South Australian Department of Water, Land and Biodiversity Conservation. These boundaries were added to the national dataset. The SA coastline was sourced using the Geoscience Australia 1:100,000 Coastline. The new SA boundaries include a marine component to the three nautical mile limit.
November 2006
Region names updated to remove / and replace with - (i.e. Hawkesbury/Nepean became Hawkesbury-Nepean). Region was removed from region names where applicable (i.e. South West Region became South West). 2006 Base Layer The base layer for this dataset is the Natural Resource Management (NRM) Region Boundaries (formerly known as Natural Heritage Trust II (NHT2) Region Boundaries (2006)). This base layer has been perdiodically reviewed and built on to develop subsequent datasets. The original 2006 base layer included an offshore component for regions in SA, TAS and QLD. Offshore components for the other States and the Northern Territories were created using Geoscience Australia's AMB 2006 coastal waters data. Mainland region boundaries were checked with all state and territory agencies resulting in changes to the internal mainland boundaries for QLD and WA. The amended boundaries were sourced from the relevant agency from these States. Geoscience Australia's Geodata Coast 100K 2004 dataset was used for mainland state/territory borders. The AMB 2006 data was used to define the offshore boundaries between the States and the Northern Territory. Offshore boundaries between NRM Regions within a State were produced by extending region boundaries at 90 degrees to the state 100k coastline unless otherwise requested by state or territory agencies.
2009 version
This version included updates to: the internal boundaries within WA and Qld; the seaward extent of coastal regions, which were extended to the 3 Nm coastal waters limit for all States and the Northern Territory; the inclusion of more offshore islands (and coastal waters); and the addition of external territories and their 12 Nm territories sea. The coastline has been removed from the data in line with the decision to extend all coastal NRM Regions to the outer limit of the adjacent coastal waters. It should be noted that the removal of the coastline means that islands lying within the outer limit of the Coastal Waters adjacent to the mainland are no longer depicted as separate features in the data. For example the many islands in Shark Bay WA are not displayed as separate entities in this dataset as they fall within the expanded (marine) extent of the Rangelands NRM Region in the new dataset. Users intending to create sub-continental scale maps to communicate locations of NRM regions boundaries are recommended to use additional layers containing coasts and near shore islands (as well as state/territory borders and major towns if required). Not all coastal waters for the States and/or the Northern Territory have been included in the data. The primary consideration was whether land based activities might affect the adjacent waters. For the 2009 and subsequent datasets, coastal waters adjacent to the mainland and islands contained in the Geodata Coast 100K dataset are included. Significant islands include Macquarie Island (Tas) and Lord Howe Island (NSW). Australia's External Territories (Heard and McDonald Islands, Cocos Keeling Islands, Christmas Island, Ashmore and Cartier Islands, and Norfolk Islands) have also been included in the 2009 and subsequent versions. The reporting region for these islands is the area within the outer limit of the 12 Nm Territorial Sea adjacent to each of these External Territories as sourced from the AMB 2006 data.
Specific issues relating to the development of the 2009 version for each State are described below:
- WA- Data supplied from different WA regions contained overlaps around the Perth NRM. The Perth NRM confirmed that the NRM bodies work across neighbouring regions. As these boundaries remain ambiguous (and are not defined in any legislation) the Australian Government Land and Coasts settled on the boundaries in this dataset for the purposes of reporting.
- NSW - Jervis Bay was added to the Southern Rivers NRM region after consultation with the Australian Government Land and Coasts NSW Team. Lord Howe Island was added to the NSW dataset as a part of the Northern Rivers NRM Region. The NSW Catchment Management Authority (CMA) Hawkesbury-Nepean, provided the marine NRM divisions between theirs and Central-Rivers, identifying that their northern regional boundary bisects Lion Island.
- VIC - The Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) provided a state NRM dataset for this update. Their boundaries matched the pre-existing NRM Region Boundaries dataset, except for one small area between East and West Gippsland. Victoria agreed to use the pre-existing NRM boundaries in this area. The addition of the 3Nm coastal waters component for Victoria presented a challenge in defining the offshore boundaries between Port Phillip and Westernport and the neighbouring NRM Regions of Corangamite and West Gippsland. The islands on the western shore of Port Phillip Bay in the vicinity of Queenscliff (Swan Island and Duck Island) and Swan Bay have been included in the Corangamite NRM region. From north to south the border between the Corangamite NRM region and Port Phillip and Westernport Bay NRM region is a line drawn from the eastern arm of Edwards Point to Swan Point, along the eastern shore of Swan Island and between the southern extremity of Swan Island to the eastern extremity of Point Queenscliff. The offshore boundary between these regions is a line drawn directly south from Point Lonsdale to the outer limit of coastal waters. Finally, the offshore boundary between Port Phillip and Westernport Bay and West Gippsland is a line drawn directly south from the town of San Remo to the outer limit of coastal waters.
- Tas - The area of Coastal Waters adjacent to the Hogan Group of islands in Bass Straight is divided between Victoria and Tasmania. For the purpose of this dataset the entire area has been allocated to the North NRM region of Tasmania.
2010 Version
The major changes to the data for this dataset are that new NRM region boundaries for South Australia which came into effect on 1 July 2009 have been incorporated into the data; and, the data structure (attributes) have been modified. Other more minor changes include: all offshore boundaries between States and/or the Northern Territory were reviewed to be consistent with the agreed coastal waters boundaries as depicted in Geoscience Australia's AMB 2006 data; the area of coastal waters adjacent to the Cooperative Management Area in Queensland has been included in that region; and, the external territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands has been added to the dataset.
2012 Version
This dataset incorporates changes to the NSW NRM regions that came into effect on 12th October 2012 (NSW Catchment Management Authorities Amendment Order 2012). Major changes are: merger of Sydney Metropolitan NRM region into the Hawkesbury Nepean NRM region; merger of Lower Murray Darling NRM region into the Murray NRM region; changes of the boundary of Western NRM region; and changes of the boundary of the Central West NRM region.
2014 Version
This 2014 version marks the change in NSW from Catchment Management Authorities (CMA) to Local Land Service areas which will now be used for NRM regions in NSW. Local Land service areas came into effect in NSW on 1 January 2014. A couple of gaps between Cape York and Torres Strait NRMs have been removed. Known discrepancies with published boundaries for several NRM regional bodies in WA (as per the 2009 version) remain in this dataset. Further detail is in the data quality report section below. Updated ""North West"" and ""South East"" NRM regions in NSW to ""North West NSW"" and ""South East NSW"" to maintain unique NRM names for PMST funtionality (July 2014).
2015 Version
This 2015 version defines the Peel-Harvey NRM region. The OceanWatch NRM has been recognised but there is no spatial information defined. Several NRM names have also been updated as a result of new information: 1. Fitzroy changed to Fitzroy Basin 2. Burdekin changed to NQ Dry Tropics 3. Wet Tropics changed to Terrain 4. Border Rivers changed to QMDC (Queensland Murray Darling Basin) 5. MacKay Whitsunday changed to Reef Catchments 6. Avon changed to Wheatbelt 7. North West changed to Cradle Coast It also updates the marine portion of the NRM regions to be consistent with the current (2014) Australian Maritime Boundaries Information System (AMBIS) coastal water limit boundary. The majority of these changes resulted in a negligible change to the boundaries (in the order of millimetres). There were, however 5 NRM regions which gained additional islands as a result of the change (Cape York, Rangelands, North, Cradle Coast and South Coast). Islands which were either within the either contiguous with the 3 nautical mile limit or in amongst other islands that were historically included in a region were added to the region boundaries. Coastal NRM region governing bodies were informed of these changes and no objections were received.
2016 Version
The 2016 version 2 updates the marine portion of the NRM regions to be consistent with the current (2015) Australian Maritime Boundaries Information System (AMBIS) coastal water limit boundary. It also includes a new unique ID field for sorting purposes (this is explained in detail below). Three NRM names have also been updated as a result of new information from relevant state/territory agencies and/or NRM regional bodies, as follows: 1. “Avon” changed to “Wheatbelt” 2. “North West” changed to “Cradle Coast” The 2016 version 2 maintains definitions established in the 2015 version, including for the Peel-Harvey NRM region and for the OceanWatch Australia Limited NRM organisation (not spatially defined). It also maintains changes made in earlier versions including: the 2014 changes in NSW from Catchment Management Authorities (CMA) to Local Land Service areas; and the 2012 update/formalisation of the 2010 dataset (which was an interim update of the NRM Regions 2009 dataset, released Feb 2009). The original base layer version of this dataset was released in 2006 as the Natural Heritage Trust II (NHT2) Region Boundaries dataset. Whilst the boundaries of NRM Regions are defined by legislation in some states and territories this dataset should not be used to represent legal boundaries in any way. It is an administrative dataset developed for the purpose of reporting and public information. It should be noted that from time to time the states and/or territories may revise their regional boundaries in accordance with local needs and therefore alterations to either the attribution or boundaries of the data may occur in the future. In total, this dataset now represents 61 NRM regions, two of which have large and remote islands which are distinguished in the spatial data, resulting in 63 map objects. The 61 NRM regions comprise 56 mainland regions administered by 55 NRM regional bodies (the Cooperative Management Area in QLD is jointly administered by the two adjacent regional bodies: the Cape York and Northern Gulf NRM bodies) and seven islands (five administered by the Australian Government as external territories, and two administered by nearby mainland NRM regional bodies, which are shown as separate map objects).
The 2016 version 2 includes a new unique ID field in the table structure to allow for sorting based on state, region name and region object (where there is more than one part).
2020 Version
The 2020 version updates the previous version (2017) with changes to boundaries of South Australian NRM Regions to align with new regional landscape boundaries (https://data.sa.gov.au/data/dataset/landscapes-sa-boundaries) under the Landscapes South Australia Act 2019 (SA) Act which replaced the Natural Resources Management Act 2004 (SA) Act. Minor edits were made to remove gaps, slivers and overlaps so the new SA boundaries aligned with non-SA NRM Regions. The ""Hills and Fleurieu"" and ""Green Adelaide"" Landscapes SA boundaries were merged to form the single 4010 ""Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges"" NRM Region, although at the request of the data owner, the previous names and internal boundaries were retained within this NRM region. Existing NRM Region names were retained and the following shows the Landscapes SA region -> NRM Region names: Landscapes SA -> NRM Regions Alinytjara Wilurara -> 4020. Alinytjara Wilurara Eyre Peninsula -> 4030. Eyre Peninsula Green Adelaide -> 4010. Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges Hills and Fleurieu -> 4010. Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges Kangaroo Islandv 4040. Kangaroo Island Limestone Coast -> 4080. South East Murraylands and Riverland -> 4070. South Australian Murray Darling Basin Northern and Yorke -> 4050. Northern and Yorke South Australian Arid Lands -> 4060. South Australian Arid Lands. Additionally a number of gaps and overlaps in the Western Australia NRM regions were fixed.
2022 Version

This version of NRM_Regions replaces the old NLPMU layer so that Regional Land Management Partners, NRM_Regions including Marine and remote Indigenous Procurement Policy area (RIPP) may be displayed using the one dataset.
‘Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges’ split into ‘Green Adelaide’ and ‘Hills and Fleurieu’.
‘Torres Strait’, ‘Green Adelaide’ and ‘Marine NRM’ added to match note management unit covered through other financial arrangements.
‘South West Queensland’, ‘Maranoa Balonne and Border Rivers’ and ‘Condamine’ combined into ‘Southern Queensland’ with light grey dotted line to denote NRM borders.
‘Torres Strait’ and ‘Green Adelaide’ symbology changed to grey hatched filling.
The management units are coloured based on their overlap with the Remote Indigenous Procurement Policy area (RIPP).
Remote management units are orange. To be included the management unit needed to have more than 50% overlap with the RIPP.
Non-remote management units are green.
Management units covered through other financial arrangements management units are grey with hatching.

This webservice is part of a set of 2016 National Land Account Experimental Estimates that provide statistics to measure changes in land attributes over time, both from an economic and an environmental perspective.

The National Land Account was produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and released under the Common national approach to environmental-economic accounting in Australia. These experimental estimates were developed in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (now Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water) and Geoscience Australia (GA), including their respective internal research areas: Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) and Digital Earth Australia (DEA).

Further information on the National Land Account, Experimental Estimates methodology can be found here.

Data considerations
The input data was not collected or validated at SA2 level. Classes with small estimates are less reliable and should be used with caution. Any discrepancies between totals and sums of components in this publication are due to rounding.

Zeros can be real zeros (or rounded to zero), or data that is not available.

SA2s that cover Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island are not in scope of the account and do not contain values.

What is ERP?
ERP links people to a place of usual residence within Australia. Usual residence is the address at which a person considers themselves to currently live. ERP includes all people who usually live in Australia (regardless of nationality, citizenship or legal status), with the exception of foreign diplomatic personnel and their families. It includes usual residents who are overseas for less than 12 months out of a continuous 16-month period. It excludes those who are in Australia for less than 12 months out of a continuous 16-month period. ERP is prepared by adding births, subtracting deaths and adding the net of overseas and internal migration to a base population derived from the latest Census of Population and Housing.

The LGA estimates in this product are subject to some error. Some caution should be exercised when using the estimates, especially for areas with very small populations. Estimates of under three people should be regarded as synthetic due to confidentiality procedures. For further information about the data see: Regional Population Methodology.

The Mineral Potential web service provides access to digital datasets used in the assessment of mineral potential in Australia. The service includes maps showing the potential for sediment-hosted base metal mineral systems in Australia.
This product shows the potential for Clastic-Dominated Siliciclastic Carbonate Zn-Pb (CDSC) mineral systems in Australia. This map is a synthesis of four component layers: sources of metals, energy drivers, lithospheric architecture, and depositional gradients, using a weighted sum to produce the final mineral potential map for the mineral system.
Supporting datasets including the input maps used to generate the mineral potential maps, an assessment criteria table that contains information on the map creation, and data uncertainty maps are available here Uncertainty Maps. The data uncertainty values range between 0 and 1, with higher uncertainty values being located in areas where more input maps are missing data or have unknown values.

Surface Geology of Australia 2012 - Miscellaneous Lines contains lines that complement the geology data, but are not classified as geological features. (eg, coastline and other water boundaries, limits of mapping or available data)
The Surface Geology of Australia 1:1M scale dataset (2012 edition) is a seamless national coverage of outcrop and surficial geology, compiled for use at or around 1:1 million scale.
The data maps outcropping bedrock geology and unconsolidated or poorly consolidated regolith material covering bedrock.
Geological units are represented as polygon and line geometries, and are attributed with information regarding stratigraphic nomenclature and hierarchy, age, lithology, and primary data source.
The dataset also contains geological contacts, structural features such as faults and shears, and miscellaneous supporting lines like the boundaries of water and ice bodies.
The 2012 dataset has been updated from the previous 2010 data by updating geological unit data to 2012 information in the Australian Stratigraphic Units Database, incorporating new published mapping in the Northern Territory and Queensland, and correcting errors or inconsistent data identified in the previous edition, particularly in the Phanerozoic geology of Western Australia.
The attribute structure of the dataset has also been revised to be more compatible with the GeoSciML data standard, published by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information.
The first edition of this national dataset was first released in 2008, with map data compiled largely from simplifying and edgematching existing 1:250 000 scale geological maps.
Where these maps were not current, more recent source maps ranging in scale from 1:50 000 to 1:1 million were used.
In some areas where the only available geological maps were old and poorly located, some repositioning of mapping using recent satellite imagery or geophysics was employed.

The Parliament consists of the King (represented by the Governor-General) and two Houses (the Senate and the House of Representatives).
The House of Representatives reviews, debates and votes on proposed laws.
Each member elected to the House of Representatives represents a single electoral division, also known as an electorate, which does not cross state or territory borders.
Each of the six states, the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory gains representation in the House of Representatives in proportion to their population, and there are a similar number of electors in each electoral division within a given state or territory.
The names and boundaries of electoral divisions within a state or territory are reviewed periodically and may be adjusted.
This process is known as a redistribution of federal electoral divisions.
The Federal Electoral Boundaries dataset contains the geographic boundaries of the federal electoral divisions in Australia.
The Senate is also often referred to as the ‘state’s house’ or the ‘house of review’.
The Senate's law-making powers are equal to those of the House of Representatives except that it cannot introduce or amend proposed laws that authorise expenditure for the ordinary annual services of the government or that impose taxation.
Those elected to the Senate are called ‘Senator’.
Senators represent all of one of the six states, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory.
There are 12 senators for each of the six states and there are two senators each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.
These boundaries are provided in vector format with Electoral Divisions represented by polygons.

The Oil and Gas Pipelines Database contains known spatial locations of onshore and offshore pipelines or pipeline corridors used to transport natural gas, oil and other liquids within Australia’s mainland and territorial waters. Onshore pipelines are represented as polylines for Qld, NSW, Vic, Tas, and SA, and polygons/corridors for WA and NT. Offshore pipelines are represented as polylines for WA, NT and Vic. Pipeline data has been provided by Petrosys GPinfo as of 24 August 2022. More information available at www.gpinfo.com.au. No effort was made to revise, value add and/or spatially improve the datasets.
For the purposes of this dataset a Pipeline is defined as: A linked series of pipes, with pumps and valves, used for the conveyance of gas, oil and liquids.
For the purposes of this dataset a Corridor is defined as: A passage of land in which a pipeline and the facilities of a pipeline operator have the potential to transverse, including rights-of-way and easements over and through public or private property

Lineage statement
The spatial boundaries were originally compiled by the NRS program and by ERIN since February 2009. Boundaries have been compiled as areas that have been declared through the IPA Programme. In 2006 ERIN revised the IPA dataset to align with the Collaborative Australian Protected Areas Database (CAPAD). This included modification of the spatial data to remove discrepancies as well as an attribution review for accuracy and completeness. This was undertaken with advice from the IPA Programme staff. Since February 2009 most boundaries have been sourced directly from the Indigenous Management Group (IMG) responsible for that IPA. Where this has occurred, it is marked in the Source field.
Note: On occasions the spatial boundaries of declared IPAs may alter as new and more up-to-date mapping is made available from IMG's to ERIN. This will alter the GIS area (Ha) figure. Some IPAs have had their boundaries realigned to be consistent with the Geoscience Australia GEODATA COAST 100K 2004 dataset

Surface Geology of Australia 2012 - Miscellaneous Lines contains lines that complement the geology data, but are not classified as geological features. (eg, coastline and other water boundaries, limits of mapping or available data)
The Surface Geology of Australia 1:1M scale dataset (2012 edition) is a seamless national coverage of outcrop and surficial geology, compiled for use at or around 1:1 million scale.
The data maps outcropping bedrock geology and unconsolidated or poorly consolidated regolith material covering bedrock.
Geological units are represented as polygon and line geometries, and are attributed with information regarding stratigraphic nomenclature and hierarchy, age, lithology, and primary data source.
The dataset also contains geological contacts, structural features such as faults and shears, and miscellaneous supporting lines like the boundaries of water and ice bodies.
The 2012 dataset has been updated from the previous 2010 data by updating geological unit data to 2012 information in the Australian Stratigraphic Units Database, incorporating new published mapping in the Northern Territory and Queensland, and correcting errors or inconsistent data identified in the previous edition, particularly in the Phanerozoic geology of Western Australia.
The attribute structure of the dataset has also been revised to be more compatible with the GeoSciML data standard, published by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information.
The first edition of this national dataset was first released in 2008, with map data compiled largely from simplifying and edgematching existing 1:250 000 scale geological maps.
Where these maps were not current, more recent source maps ranging in scale from 1:50 000 to 1:1 million were used.
In some areas where the only available geological maps were old and poorly located, some repositioning of mapping using recent satellite imagery or geophysics was employed.

The Parliament consists of the King (represented by the Governor-General) and two Houses (the Senate and the House of Representatives).
The House of Representatives reviews, debates and votes on proposed laws.
Each member elected to the House of Representatives represents a single electoral division, also known as an electorate, which does not cross state or territory borders.
Each of the six states, the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory gains representation in the House of Representatives in proportion to their population, and there are a similar number of electors in each electoral division within a given state or territory.
The names and boundaries of electoral divisions within a state or territory are reviewed periodically and may be adjusted.
This process is known as a redistribution of federal electoral divisions.
The Federal Electoral Boundaries dataset contains the geographic boundaries of the federal electoral divisions in Australia.
The Senate is also often referred to as the ‘state’s house’ or the ‘house of review’.
The Senate's law-making powers are equal to those of the House of Representatives except that it cannot introduce or amend proposed laws that authorise expenditure for the ordinary annual services of the government or that impose taxation.
Those elected to the Senate are called ‘Senator’.
Senators represent all of one of the six states, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory.
There are 12 senators for each of the six states and there are two senators each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.
These boundaries are provided in vector format with Electoral Divisions represented by polygons.

The Mineral Potential web service provides access to digital datasets used in the assessment of mineral potential in Australia. The service includes maps showing the potential for sediment-hosted base metal mineral systems in Australia.
This product shows the potential for Clastic-Dominated Siliciclastic Carbonate Zn-Pb (CDSC) mineral systems in Australia. This map is a synthesis of four component layers: sources of metals, energy drivers, lithospheric architecture, and depositional gradients, using a weighted sum to produce the final mineral potential map for the mineral system.
Supporting datasets including the input maps used to generate the mineral potential maps, an assessment criteria table that contains information on the map creation, and data uncertainty maps are available here Uncertainty Maps. The data uncertainty values range between 0 and 1, with higher uncertainty values being located in areas where more input maps are missing data or have unknown values.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) partnered with industry and other stakeholders to co-design methods to produce agriculture statistics using new data sources.  Traditionally, agriculture area and production statistics are produced by the ABS through an annual agricultural survey or a five yearly agricultural census which collects information directly from farm businesses. These experimental sugarcane statistics demonstrate that these non-survey data sources can produce accurate and more timely statistics at a level of regional detail normally only available from an agricultural census.

These experimental sugarcane statistics for production, area of harvest and business counts were produced by combining Levy Payers Register administrative data with satellite derived crop mapping. More information on the method and approach can be found here and feedback to further refine it is welcomed via email: agriculture.statistics@abs.gov.au.

Data points of ‘less than 5’ in the original data have been converted to blank cells as part of the web service production process due to the need for web service data to be integers only, whilst continuing to suppress any values less than 5. Similarly, ‘-‘ entries in the original data which symbolised a null result (i.e. no production detected) have also been converted to a blank cell. The original data containing ‘less than 5’ and ‘-‘ annotations can be accessed here.

Australia's Land Borders is a product within the Foundation Spatial Data Framework (FSDF) suite of datasets. It is endorsed by the ANZLIC – the Spatial Information Council and the Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping (ICSM) as the nationally consistent representation of the land borders as published by the Australian states and territories. It is topologically correct in relation to published jurisdictional land borders and the Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF).
The purpose of this product is to provide:

a building block which enables development of other national datasets;
integration with other geospatial frameworks in support of data analysis; and
visualisation of these borders as cartographic depiction on a map.

Although this service depicts land borders, it is not nor does it purport to be a legal definition of these borders. Therefore it cannot and must not be used for those use-cases pertaining to legal context.
Termination Points are the point at which the state border polylines meet the coastline.  For the purpose of this product, the coastline is defined as the Mean High Water Mark (MHWM). In the absence of a new MHWM for NSW, the Jervis Bay termination points are defined by the NSW cadastre.
This feature layer is a sub-layer of the Land Borders service.

Source information
Catalog entry: Australia's Land Borders
The Land Borders dataset is created using a range of source data including:

Australian Capital Territory data was sourced from the ACT Government GeoHub – ‘ACT Boundary’. No changes have been made to the polylines or vertices of the source data.
In the absence of any custodian published border for Jervis Bay – New South Wales, a border has been constructed from the boundary of the NSW cadastre supplied by NSW Spatial Services. Geoscience Australia’s GEODATA TOPO 250K data was considered as an alternative, however, that border terminated short of the coastline as it stops at the shoreline of the major water bodies. Therefore, a decision was made to use the NSW and OT supplied cadastre to create a new representation of the Jervis Bay border that continued to the coastline (MHWM), in place of the TOPO 250K data.
In the absence of publicly available data from New South Wales, the land borders for New South Wales have been constructed using the data of adjoining states Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. This approach is agreeable to New South Wales Government for this interim product.
In the absence of publicly available data from the Northern Territory the land borders for the Northern Territory have been constructed using the data of adjoining states Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia. This approach is agreeable to Northern Territory Government for this interim product.
Queensland state border and coastline data have been download from the Queensland Spatial, Catalogue – QSpatial.
Publicly available data for the state borders of South Australia was downloaded from data.gov.au and is ‘SA State Boundary - PSMA Administrative Boundaries’. Downloaded as a file geodatabase in GDA2020.
Victorian state border data has been downloaded from the Victorian state Government Spatial Datamart, it is titled ‘FR_FRAMEWORK_AREA_LINE’. The Victorian state border data was used for the NSW/VIC section of border due to the absence of any publicly available data from New South Wales for this section of the border.
Western Australian state border data was downloaded from the WA Government as publicly available. The Western Australia state border data has been used for the WA/NT section of the border due to the absence of publicly available data from Northern Territory for this section of the border. Selecting the SA data for the WA/SA border would introduce mismatches with the WA cadastre. It would also not improve the SA relationship with the SA cadastre. Using the WA data for the WA/SA section of the border aligns each state with its own cadastre without causing overlaps.

Lineage statement
At the southwest end of the NT/SA/WA border the South Australian data for the border was edited by moving the end vertex ~1.7m to correctly create the intersection of the 3 states (SA/WA/NT).
At the southeast end of the NT/QLD/SA border the South Australian data for the border was edited by moving the end vertex ~0.4m to correctly create the intersection of the 3 states (NT/SA/QLD).
Queensland data was used for the NT/QLD border and the QLD/NSW border due to the absence of publicly available data from the Northern Territory for these section of the border.  Data published by Queensland also included a border sections running westwards along the southern Northern Territory border and southwards along the western New South Wales border.  These two sections were excluded from the product as they are not within the state of Queensland. Queensland data was also used in the entirety for the SA/QLD segment of the land borders.  Although the maximum overlap between SA and QLD state border data was less than ~5m (and varied along the border), the Queensland data closely matched its own cadastre and that of South Australia.  The South Australian data overlapped the Queensland data, it also did not match the South Australian cadastre.  Therefore, a decision to use the Queensland data for the QLD/SA section of the border ensured the best possible topological consistency with the published cadastre of each state.
The South Australian/Victorian state border, north-south, were generally very similar with some minor deviations from each other from less than 1m to ~60m (there is one instance of deviation of 170m). The section of border that follows the Murray River is matched, for the most part by both states. Over three quarters of the border running along the river is matched with both states. There is a mismatch between the states in the last quarter of the border along the river, the northern section, however, both states still have the border running inside, or along, the river polygon (Surface hydrology), the Victorian data was chosen for this section purely for consistency as the Victorian data was used for the preceding arcs.
Overall, the Victorian data was selected for use as the South Australia/Victoria land border. After taking the existing cadastre and GNAF points into account and it did not introduce extra errors into the relationship between the land borders and the cadastre of either state. In parts, it improved the relationship between the South Australian cadastre and the SA/VIC state border.
This interim product will be updated when all states and territories have published agreed, authoritative representations of their land borders. This product will also be updated to include land mass polygons at time when the Coastline Capture Program is complete. This dataset is GDA 2020 compliant - transformed into GDA2020 from it's original source datum. Reference System Code 2020.00.

This dataset is a subset of Australian Geological Provinces 2018, 1:1 Million Scale and describes the extents of Paleozoic to Mesozoic tectonic provinces of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
The Australian Geological Provinces Database contains descriptions and spatial extents of the fundamental geological elements of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
Province types include sedimentary basins, tectonic provinces such as cratons and orogens, igneous provinces, and metallogenic provinces.
Spatial data has been captured largely at approximately 1:1M scale for intended use between 1:2M and 1:5M scale. This edition (2018.01) of the dataset is NOT a complete representation of all of Australia's geological provinces.
Further work is required to complete the national geological province collection. Additionally, not all the provinces supplied herein have undergone a rigorous quality assurance (QA) check to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their descriptions.
Where possible, provinces have been attributed with their age, contained lithostratigraphic units, relationships to other provinces, geological history, mineral resource occurrences, and selected published references.
The geological definition of some provinces is contentious.
While every effort has been made to achieve a consensus interpretation of each province, including significant collaboration with state and territory geological surveys, scientific debate may still occur about the nature and extent of some provinces. The full 2D spatial extent (ie, including the extent of a province under any overlying cover material) of provinces has been captured.
Additionally, the extent of outcrop of some provinces has also been captured. Where possible, the full extent outlines of provinces have been attributed with information about the source, accuracy, and observation method of those lines.

Why this is useful

Better understand how your local community is changing over time.
Data from 2016 means both spatial and time-related analyses can be performed.
Identify trajectories in the number of recipients by SA2, to identify appropriate services for changing communities.
Help vulnerable communities plan for and respond to emergencies.
Note: reporting rules and policy settings have changed over time. The data from different periods may not be directly comparable. Each Statistical Area is duplicated 32 times, one for each quarter. For each quarter there are over 20 benefit types. Presenting all of that information on one map is impossible. Even displaying one benefit type for all SA2s for one quarter will be slow to display. If possible limit investigations to a small geographic area or time period. To begin, decide if you want to investigate the spatial distribution of recipients of a payment type or concession card across multiple SA2s, or if you want to investigate how the number of recipients of a payment type or concession card changes over time.

Lineage Statement
This layer was put together using two data sources: social security data provided by the Department of Social Services was joined to the Statistical Areas Level 2 provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
Social Security Recipients

A recipient or card holder is counted if they are current or suspended on the Centrelink payment system as at the end of the quarter. The address provided by a recipient or card holder is geocoded to determine their SA2.
From December 2022, to protect individuals’ privacy, all counts have been rounded to the nearest 5. Values from 1 to 7 are rounded to 5. Zero counts are actual zeros. This may result in non-additivity for some totals. Caution should be taken in re-calculating totals from rounded data, as this may compound the effects of rounding. Prior to December 2022, where a SA2 has 5 or less recipients, the number 0 or 5 was randomly assigned to the SA2 to ensure individuals can not be identified.
The payment type ""Commonwealth Rent Assistance income units"" is only available from March 2017.
Widow B Pension ceased on 20 March 2020. Recipients were transferred to the Age Pension.

The data available at data.gov.au was used.

dss-payments-2016-sa2-jun-2019-to-mar-2023 map-historic.csv
dss-demographics-2021-sa2-december-2023.csv
Each file contains about 30 columns. Each row describes the number of recipients for each benefit type for the end of each quarter and the SA2 in which the recipient resides.
For example, a typical line in dss-payments-2016-sa2-jun-2019-to-mar-2023 map-historic.csv looks like.
2019-03,11007,Braidwood,0,5,487,5,76,5,42,113,147,203,165,172,106,23,10,32,806,0,7,8,143,0,5,0,5,5
2019-03 - Last month of the quarter.
11007 -  Unique five digit code comprising the State and Territory identifier and SA2 identifier. NSW is 1, Braidwood is 1007.
Braidwood - Unique name given to each SA2.
All subsequent integers are recipient and card holder counts for that SA2.
In dss-demographics-2021-sa2-december-2023.csv the 9 digit identifier replaces the 5 digit code used in the previous two CSVs. This is because as at ASGS edition 3 the 5 digit codes are no longer used.
See ABS for more information.
Columns in each CSV were renamed to ensure consistency across the entire time period. Some columns were merged as shown below.

Australian Statistical Geography - Statistical Area Level 2
The Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) is a classification of Australia into a hierarchy of statistical areas. First introduced in 2011, the ASGS replaced the Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) that had been used since 1984. The ASGS is a social geography, developed to reflect the location of people and communities, and used for the release and analysis of statistics and other data. The ASGS is updated every 5 years to account for growth and change in Australia's population, economy and infrastructure.
The Statistical Area Level 2 is the third highest resolution (third lowest level) in the ASGS hierarchy of social geography.

Three editions of ASGS are used in this product: Edition 1 2011, Edition 2 2016 and Edition 3 2021. They are all available from the ABS as ArcGIS Feature Services.

The first CSV file has more SA2s than the service provided by the ABS. The second CSV has the same number and the third has less. This discrepancy is due to the inconsistent use and representation of special purpose code SA2s in both the DSS CSVs and ABS web feature services. Special purpose code SA2s are used by ABS to capture demographics for people in transit such as air and ship crews and people with no fixed address. They are not represented by geographies in the ABS provided ASGS feature services until edition 3 when they exist in the table but they have no geometry.
When the social security data is joined to the ASGS geographies all records for special purpose code SA2s are dropped in Edition 1 and Edition 3 making it appear there has been data loss. The special purpose code SA2s are included in the first CSV however the number of all recipients in each one is zero.
Update Method
The number of payment and concession card holders will be determined by DSS at the end of each quarter. Priorities and resources will determine when the update is placed into data.gov.au. New updates will be added to the existing file ""dss-demographics-2021-sa2-december-2023.csv"" while the DSS use the 2021 ASGS Edition 3 SA2s. In 2026 when the ABS release ASGS Edtion 4, a new CSV file will be made available in data.gov.au and updates made to it.
While the current CSV file is being updated by DSS the Python script below can be used to add the new quarter. The script could be modified to only pick up the changes or run as is. With appropriate permissions the script could be automated to poll the CSV data.gov.au to determine if any changes have been made. Once DSS add a new CSV file the script will need to be modified.
Scripts
All data manipulation, joins and spatial operations were performed using Python 3.9.16, Pandas 1.4.4, Geopandas 0.12.2 and ArcGIS API for Python 2.1.0.2. The full script is available from the Geoscience Australia Digital Atlas of Australia GitHub repository. Path is data/DSS Payments by SA2/data preparation/download and prep.ipynb.

This feature is a subset of Key ecological features.
Key ecological features (KEFs) meet one or more of the following criteria:

a species, group of species, or a community with a regionally important ecological role (e.g. a predator, prey that affects a large biomass or number of other marine species);
a species, group of species, or a community that is nationally or regionally important for biodiversity;
an area or habitat that is nationally or regionally important for:
enhanced or high productivity (such as predictable upwellings - an upwelling occurs when cold nutrient-rich waters from the bottom of the ocean rise to the surface);
aggregations of marine life (such as feeding, resting, breeding or nursery areas);
biodiversity and endemism (species which only occur in a specific area); or

a unique seafloor feature, with known or presumed ecological properties of regional significance.

KEFs have been identified by the Australian Government on the basis of advice from scientists about the ecological processes and characteristics of the area.
A workshop held in Darwin in 2007 also contributed to this scientific advice and helped to underpin the identification of key ecological features.
As new information becomes available, the spatial representations of identified key ecological features will continue to be refined and updated.
Sixteen KEFs have been identified in the South-west Marine Region:

Commonwealth marine environment surrounding the Houtman Abrolhos Islands

The Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric) identifies and registers the spatial relationships between important hydrological features such as watercourses, water bodies, canals, aquifers, monitoring points and catchments. Geofabric Surface Catchments provides a hierarchy of nested catchments from drainage divisions at the top level all the way down to a separate catchment for every stream segment in Geofabric Surface Network. Catchment boundaries derived from the 1 second Digital Elevation Model, with ~7 million base level catchments.
The feature class contained within this data product is based upon the stream segment level catchments of the Catchment Boundary Vector - foundation input data. These data define a catchment for every stream segment contained within Geofabric Surface Network (AHGFNetworkStream) according to the1 second DEM. It is these catchments which serve as direct input into the AHGF Catchment feature class. Surface Catchments define the base level of catchments for stream segments, sinks and coastal draining areas. Surface catchments are contiguous areas which, according to a flow direction grid, drain to a single stream segment. Universities, governments and consultants use these to identify contributing catchment areas.
Australian Rivers, Lakes and water storages are all connected. The complex nature of our water system means that understanding these connections is vital for the effective management of water resources. The Geofabric is a specialised Geographic Information System. It is like a digital street directory of australia's important water features. It lets you map how water is moved, used and stored throughout the landscape. It is an authoritative information source that works seamlessly across australia. The Geofabric is made up of six datasets for use in hydrological visualisation, analysis and reporting. First up, the Hydrology reporting regions define australia's drainage divisions and river regions. This is used for reporting by government and other organisations. Hydrology Reporting Catchments are the building blocks of reporting regions. They provide finer detail for smaller rivers. Surface Cartography lets you visualise surface water features such as canals and bridges. This context is great for water managers and emergency services, for example to anticipate downstream communities affected by floods. This is achieved in combination with the Surface Network which links streamflows that can connect when there are high water flows. Visualising these full networks helps with streamflow forecasting. You can trace these connected and directed stream networks, and link them to Surface Catchments. This lets you identify the upstream contributing catchment area for a selected stream segment. Hydrologists use this to define networks and related catchments, and to inform environmental management and reporting. Groundwater Cartography shows groundwater resources and their features such as salinity as well as the rocks and sediments at different levels below the surface. This adds to the Geofabric’s detailed map of how our water system is connected. All information has been standardised across the country. This is why the Geofabric is widely used for streamflow analysis and the creation of customised catchments. Tutorials and a sample toolkit are available to help you perform common tasks. The Geofabric is continually being improved.

The burnt areas represent curated jurisdictional owned polygons of bushfires and prescribed (planned) burns. This dataset was produced under Work Stream 1C - Activity 3 of the National Bushfire Intelligence Capability (NBIC) , a collaborative partnership between: Australian Climate Service CSIRO (NBIC) Geoscience Australia Emergency Management Spatial Information Network (EMSINA) Under agreement this Project (Activity 3) will release a nationally consistent, harmonised and standardised historical bushfire boundary dataset derived from the authoritative state and territory agencies in both 2023 (this dataset) and again in November 2024. The information released within this dataset is reflective of the data supplied by participating authoritative agencies. It may, or may not, represent all fire history within that jurisdiction. Geoscience Australia's role within this project is to: negotiate access to the state/territory historic bushfire boundary datasets aggregate, harmonise and standardise the jurisdictional data against the Australasian Fire Authorities Council (AFAC) National Bushfire Boundary Standards host the completed spatial product(s) arrange for the 'Historical Bushfire Boundaries' spatial dataset to be accessible through Geoscience Australia’s external data catalogues and through the new Digital Atlas of Australia platform ensure stakeholders have access to regular project updates. To harmonsise and standardise this dataset Geoscience Australia have utilised the AFAC endorsed data dictionary for fire history. This data dictionary and the definitions provided allowed Geoscience Australia to map common attributes from both sources. Unfortunately, not all attributes mapped across like-for-like.

Work is underway with the relevant agencies to incorporate Northern Territory Government approved Historical Bushfire Boundary data in the future. Product standardisation: The data provided by each jurisdiction is standardised and harmonised. This process maps the existing state/territory attributes to the National Data Schema that was agreed to and endorsed by the participating state agencies and the Australian Fire and Emergency Services Authorities Council. The Digital Atlas of Australia data team published an optimised Bushfire Boundaries Historic dataset designed to perform efficiently in either a desktop application or a web service. This process utilised FME to reduce the processing time on millions of vertices within the complex dataset: Dataset projected to epsg:4326 to align with the near real time services hosted on the Digital Atlas of Australia Removes island or donut polygons within a fire extent, therefore a fire extent is shown with an outline and no internal parts Create separate polygon chunks based on 10000 vertices while maintaining the same attributes for each chunk of the identified fire, if a fire consists of multiple polygons each polygon is counted separately within the identified fire As a result the Bushfire Boundaries Historic dataset hosted in the Digital Atlas of Australia has more records than the original dataset.

This publication is the fourth in an annual series that uses vehicle telematics data to provide measures of traffic congestion for freight vehicles for selected routes across Australia’s five mainland state capital cities—Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. The selected routes comprise the major motorways, highways and arterial roads within each city that service both passenger and freight vehicles. This release includes measures for 71 routes. The estimates presented in this report cover calendar year 2022, and include comparisons with 2021 traffic congestion levels.
This is the first year since the initial report, in 2019, where none of Australia’s capital cities experienced major lockdowns as part of the COVID-19 pandemic, and city-wide congestion levels have more or less returned to pre-pandemic levels. In particular, city-wide vehicle congestion, as measured by the mean excess time index, increased (worsened) in Sydney, Melbourne and, to a lesser extent, Adelaide between 2021 and 2022, but decreased (improved) in Brisbane and Perth. Many individual motorway routes exhibit increased congestion at morning and afternoon peaks in 2022, compared to 2020 and 2021. On some routes measured congestion is still lower than the pre-pandemic results in 2019. On other routes, congestion peaks exceed 2019 levels. Copies of the data displayed in the report are available here and on data.gov.au.

BITRE used freight telematics data to collate speeds experienced by freight vehicles on individual road segments. A sample of heavy vehicles was used to calculate median travel time for each road segment. Open Street Map (OSM) road segments were used. The methodology used to process the data is available in the BITRE github repository and on the National Freight Data Hub data catalogue.
A snapshot of the OSM data was taken in the January of the following year of analysis as it is the best representation of Australian roads as they were in that year.

The Mineral Potential web service provides access to digital datasets used in the assessment of mineral potential in Australia. The service includes maps showing the potential for sediment-hosted base metal mineral systems in Australia.
This product shows the potential for Mississippi Valley-Type Zn-Pb (MVT) mineral systems in Australia. This map is a synthesis of four component layers: sources of metals, energy drivers, lithospheric architecture, and depositional gradients, using a weighted sum to produce the final mineral potential map for the mineral system.
Supporting datasets including the input maps used to generate the mineral potential maps, an assessment criteria table that contains information on the map creation, and data uncertainty maps are available here Uncertainty Maps. The data uncertainty values range between 0 and 1, with higher uncertainty values being located in areas where more input maps are missing data or have unknown values.

This dataset is a subset of Australian Geological Provinces 2018, 1:1 Million Scale and describes the extents of Early Paleozoic sedimentary basins of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
The Australian Geological Provinces Database contains descriptions and spatial extents of the fundamental geological elements of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
Province types include sedimentary basins, tectonic provinces such as cratons and orogens, igneous provinces, and metallogenic provinces.
Spatial data has been captured largely at approximately 1:1M scale for intended use between 1:2M and 1:5M scale. This edition (2018.01) of the dataset is NOT a complete representation of all of Australia's geological provinces.
Further work is required to complete the national geological province collection. Additionally, not all the provinces supplied herein have undergone a rigorous quality assurance (QA) check to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their descriptions.
Where possible, provinces have been attributed with their age, contained lithostratigraphic units, relationships to other provinces, geological history, mineral resource occurrences, and selected published references.
The geological definition of some provinces is contentious.
While every effort has been made to achieve a consensus interpretation of each province, including significant collaboration with state and territory geological surveys, scientific debate may still occur about the nature and extent of some provinces. The full 2D spatial extent (ie, including the extent of a province under any overlying cover material) of provinces has been captured.
Additionally, the extent of outcrop of some provinces has also been captured. Where possible, the full extent outlines of provinces have been attributed with information about the source, accuracy, and observation method of those lines.

Surface Geology of Australia 2012 - Lines contains geological units (outcrop or near-outcrop) that are too narrow to be represented by polygons
The Surface Geology of Australia 1:1M scale dataset (2012 edition) is a seamless national coverage of outcrop and surficial geology, compiled for use at or around 1:1 million scale.
The data maps outcropping bedrock geology and unconsolidated or poorly consolidated regolith material covering bedrock.
Geological units are represented as polygon and line geometries, and are attributed with information regarding stratigraphic nomenclature and hierarchy, age, lithology, and primary data source.
The dataset also contains geological contacts, structural features such as faults and shears, and miscellaneous supporting lines like the boundaries of water and ice bodies.
The 2012 dataset has been updated from the previous 2010 data by updating geological unit data to 2012 information in the Australian Stratigraphic Units Database, incorporating new published mapping in the Northern Territory and Queensland, and correcting errors or inconsistent data identified in the previous edition, particularly in the Phanerozoic geology of Western Australia.
The attribute structure of the dataset has also been revised to be more compatible with the GeoSciML data standard, published by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information.
The first edition of this national dataset was first released in 2008, with map data compiled largely from simplifying and edgematching existing 1:250 000 scale geological maps.
Where these maps were not current, more recent source maps ranging in scale from 1:50 000 to 1:1 million were used.
In some areas where the only available geological maps were old and poorly located, some repositioning of mapping using recent satellite imagery or geophysics was employed.

This dataset is a subset of Australian Geological Provinces 2018, 1:1 Million Scale and delineates major upper crustal elements.
The Australian Geological Provinces Database contains descriptions and spatial extents of the fundamental geological elements of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
Province types include sedimentary basins, tectonic provinces such as cratons and orogens, igneous provinces, and metallogenic provinces.
Spatial data has been captured largely at approximately 1:1M scale for intended use between 1:2M and 1:5M scale. This edition (2018.01) of the dataset is NOT a complete representation of all of Australia's geological provinces.
Further work is required to complete the national geological province collection. Additionally, not all the provinces supplied herein have undergone a rigorous quality assurance (QA) check to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their descriptions.
Where possible, provinces have been attributed with their age, contained lithostratigraphic units, relationships to other provinces, geological history, mineral resource occurrences, and selected published references.
The geological definition of some provinces is contentious.
While every effort has been made to achieve a consensus interpretation of each province, including significant collaboration with state and territory geological surveys, scientific debate may still occur about the nature and extent of some provinces. The full 2D spatial extent (ie, including the extent of a province under any overlying cover material) of provinces has been captured.
Additionally, the extent of outcrop of some provinces has also been captured. Where possible, the full extent outlines of provinces have been attributed with information about the source, accuracy, and observation method of those lines.

Lineage statement
The spatial data (polygons and lines) was compiled typically at or around 1:1 million scale from a wide range of published surface geology maps, bedrock or basement geology maps, borehole data, and geophysical imagery.
Where province boundaries crossed jurisdictional borders, Geoscience Australia worked with State and Territory geological agencies to achieve an agreed spatial extent.
Descriptive attribute data was compiled from authoritative published literature wherever possible, and names of these references are supplied with the data.
Not all the data in this edition of the dataset (2018.01) has undergone rigorous quality control.

Lineage statement
The electricity transmission lines, substations and power stations were digitized in 2011 (version 1) from the library of imagery held within Geoscience Australia. Imagery used ranged from 0.15m to 2.5m resolution. This data was revised (Version 2) in March 2017 using Esri World Imagery. Version 3 was revised in 2019-2021 using Esri World Imagery, and combined the three separate datasets into a single Foundation Electricity Infrastructure product.

Lineage statement
Using the previous Emergency Management Facilities datasets (2018) acquired from State and Territory agencies, the data was uploaded into an ArcSDE environment using Feature Manipulation Engine (FME). The process included the extraction of the themed features, and the translation of the data into a schema created by the Built Environment & Exposure Section, National Location Information Branch, Geoscience Australia (GA). In 2023 further FME processing was completed where the dataset was address matched using the original address provided and compared with the Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF) data. If no address match occurred GIS specialists attempted to find a relevant corresponding G-NAF address to join to, where possible.

Waterbodies are bodies of fresh water with potential significance for water balance and water reporting purposes. Composited from AusHydro V2, waterbodies comprise three major categories -

Lakes: A naturally occurring body of mainly static water surrounded by land.
Reservoirs: A body of water collected and stored behind a constructed barrier for some specific use (with the exception of Flood Irrigation Storage).
Swamp (subset of AusHydro feature class ""Flats""): Land which is so saturated with water that it is not suitable for agricultural or pastoral use and presents a barrier to free passage or Low lying land usually adjacent to lakes or watercourses, which is regularly covered with flood water for short periods.

These features represent waterbodies that are related to the stream networks by storing the HydroID of the most downstream outlet JunctionNode. These features will also contain MappedArtificialFlowSegment.
A subset of the water bodies within the AHGFWaterBody Feature Class are associated with the Bureau’s Water Storage Product and are attributed by SLAKE_Name, SLAKE_Syst and SLAKE_URN.

Digital Earth Australia Coastlines is a continental dataset that includes annual shorelines and rates of coastal change along the entire Australian coastline from 1988 to the present.
The product combines satellite data from Geoscience Australia's Digital Earth Australia program with tidal modelling to map the most representative location of the shoreline at mean sea level for each year. The product enables trends of coastal retreat and growth to be examined annually at both a local and continental scale, and for patterns of coastal change to be mapped historically and updated regularly as data continues to be acquired. This allows current rates of coastal change to be compared with that observed in previous years or decades.
The ability to map shoreline positions for each year provides valuable insights into whether changes to our coastline are the result of particular events or actions, or a process of more gradual change over time. This information can enable scientists, managers and policy makers to assess impacts from the range of drivers impacting our coastlines and potentially assist planning and forecasting for future scenarios.
The DEA Coastlines product contains five layers:

Annual shorelines
Rates of change points
Coastal change hotspots (1 km)
Coastal change hotspots (5 km)
Coastal change hotspots (10 km)

Annual shorelines
Annual shoreline vectors that represent the median or ‘most representative’ position of the shoreline at approximately 0 m Above Mean Sea Level for each year since 1988. Dashed shorelines have low certainty.
Rates of change points
A point dataset providing robust rates of coastal change for every 30 m along Australia’s non-rocky coastlines. The most recent annual shoreline is used as a baseline for measuring rates of change.
Points are shown for locations with statistically significant rates of change (p-value sig_time below) and good quality data (certainty = ""good""; see certainty below) only.
Each point shows annual rates of change (in metres per year; see rate_time below), and an estimate of uncertainty in brackets (95% confidence interval; see se_time).
For example, there is a 95% chance that a point with a label -10.0 m (±1.0 m) is retreating at a rate of between -9.0 and -11.0 metres per year.
Coastal change hotspots (1 km, 5 km, 10 km)
Three points layers summarising coastal change within moving 1 km, 5 km and 10km windows along the coastline. These layers are useful for visualising regional or continental-scale patterns of coastal change.

Annual shorelines

Attribute name
Description

OBJECTID
Automatically generated system ID

year
The year of each annual shoreline

certainty
A column providing important data quality flags for each annual shoreline (see the Quality assurance section of the product description and metadata page for more detail about each data quality flag)

tide_datum
The tide datum of each annual shoreline (e.g. ""0 m AMSL"")

id_primary
The name of the annual shoreline's Primary sediment compartment from the Australian Coastal Sediment Compartments framework

Rates of change points and Coastal change hotspots

Attribute name
Description

OBJECTID
Automatically generated system ID

uid
A unique geohash identifier for each point

rate_time
Annual rates of change (in metres per year) calculated by linearly regressing annual shoreline distances against time (excluding outliers). Negative values indicate retreat and positive values indicate growth

sig_time
Significance (p-value) of the linear relationship between annual shoreline distances and time. Small values (e.g. p-value < 0.01 or 0.05) may indicate a coastline is undergoing consistent coastal change through time

se-time
Standard error (in metres) of the linear relationship between annual shoreline distances and time. This can be used to generate confidence intervals around the rate of change given by rate_time (e.g. 95% confidence interval = se_time * 1.96).

outl_time
Individual annual shoreline are noisy estimators of coastline position that can be influenced by environmental conditions (e.g. clouds, breaking waves, sea spray) or modelling issues (e.g. poor tidal modelling results or limited clear satellite observations). To obtain reliable rates of change, outlier shorelines are excluded using a robust Median Absolute Deviation outlier detection algorithm, and recorded in this column

dist_1990, dist_1991, etc
Annual shoreline distances (in metres) relative to the most recent baseline shoreline. Negative values indicate that an annual shoreline was located inland of the baseline shoreline. By definition, the most recent baseline column will always have a distance of 0 m

angle_mean, angle_std
The mean angle and standard deviation between the baseline point to all annual shorelines. This data is used to calculate how well shorelines fall along a consistent line; high angular standard deviation indicates that derived rates of change are unlikely to be correct

valid_obs, valid_span
The total number of valid (i.e. non-outliers, non-missing) annual shoreline observations, and the maximum number of years between the first and last valid annual shoreline

sce
Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE). A measure of the maximum change or variability across all annual shorelines, calculated by computing the maximum distance between any two annual shorelines (excluding outliers). This statistic excludes sub-annual shoreline variability like tides, storms and seasonal effects

nsm
Net Shoreline Movement (NSM). The distance between the oldest (1988) and most recent annual shoreline (excluding outliers). Negative values indicate the coastline retreated between the oldest and most recent shoreline; positive values indicate growth. This statistic does not reflect sub-annual shoreline variability, so will underestimate the full extent of variability at any given location

max_year, min_year
The year that annual shorelines were at their maximum (i.e. located furthest towards the ocean) and their minimum (i.e. located furthest inland) respectively (excluding outliers). This statistic excludes sub-annual shoreline variability

certainty
A column providing important data quality flags for each annual shoreline (see the Quality assurance section of the product description and metadata page for more detail about each data quality flag)

id_primary
The name of the point's Primary sediment compartment from the Australian Coastal Sediment Compartments framework

This feature layer describes the boundaries of Australia’s PHNs, as of August 2023. PHNs are independent organisations that the Australian Government funds to manage health regions. A board oversees their work, and clinical councils and community advisory committees provide advice.
Australia has 31 PHN regions which closely align with the state and territory local hospital networks.
PHNs have the 2 key goals of:

improving the efficiency and effectiveness of health services for people, particularly those at risk of poor health outcomes
improving the coordination of health services, and increasing access and quality support for people.

To achieve these goals, PHNs:

assess the health needs of their region using a people-centred approach
commission health services to meet the prioritised health needs of the people in their region
work closely with providers to build health workforce capacity and ensure they deliver high-quality care
connect health services for people to encourage better use of health resources and avoid duplication.

For further information about PHNs, please visit the Department of Health and Aged Care’s website.

Surface Geology of Australia 2012 - Contacts contains all contacts between polygons of different stratigraphic units. Types include depositional, structural, igneous, metamorphic and compositional contacts.
The Surface Geology of Australia 1:1M scale dataset (2012 edition) is a seamless national coverage of outcrop and surficial geology, compiled for use at or around 1:1 million scale.
The data maps outcropping bedrock geology and unconsolidated or poorly consolidated regolith material covering bedrock.
Geological units are represented as polygon and line geometries, and are attributed with information regarding stratigraphic nomenclature and hierarchy, age, lithology, and primary data source.
The dataset also contains geological contacts, structural features such as faults and shears, and miscellaneous supporting lines like the boundaries of water and ice bodies.
The 2012 dataset has been updated from the previous 2010 data by updating geological unit data to 2012 information in the Australian Stratigraphic Units Database, incorporating new published mapping in the Northern Territory and Queensland, and correcting errors or inconsistent data identified in the previous edition, particularly in the Phanerozoic geology of Western Australia.
The attribute structure of the dataset has also been revised to be more compatible with the GeoSciML data standard, published by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information.
The first edition of this national dataset was first released in 2008, with map data compiled largely from simplifying and edgematching existing 1:250 000 scale geological maps.
Where these maps were not current, more recent source maps ranging in scale from 1:50 000 to 1:1 million were used.
In some areas where the only available geological maps were old and poorly located, some repositioning of mapping using recent satellite imagery or geophysics was employed.

The Mineral Potential web service provides access to digital datasets used in the assessment of mineral potential in Australia. The service includes maps showing the potential for sediment-hosted base metal mineral systems in Australia.
This product shows the potential for sediment-hosted copper mineral systems in Australia (incorporating sediment-hosted stratiform copper and Mount Isa-type copper systems). This map is derived from just one mineral system component layer, lithospheric architecture, and excludes any maps that do not have complete or near-complete national coverage. The input maps are integrated using a knowledge-driven approach to produce the final mineral potential map for the mineral system.
Supporting datasets including the input maps used to generate the mineral potential maps, an assessment criteria table that contains information on the map creation, and data uncertainty maps are available here Uncertainty Maps. The data uncertainty values range between 0 and 1, with higher uncertainty values being located in areas where more input maps are missing data or have unknown values.

The Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric) identifies and registers the spatial relationships between important hydrological features such as watercourses, water bodies, canals, aquifers, monitoring points and catchments.
Geofabric Hydrology Reporting Regions are derived from aggregations of contracted catchments from Geofabric Hydrology Reporting Catchments. This product contains two candidate reporting regions, namely AWRA Drainage Division for national scale reporting purposes and River Region for regional scale reporting purposes. More reporting regions may be added in future releases based on user requirements. The River Regions were based on a specification developed by Bureau hydrologists involved in water resources assessment in consultation with the Geofabric team and scientists from CSIRO and ANU. These boundaries were developed for use in regional scale reporting and hydrological modelling. The River Region boundaries were not used in the Australian Water Resources Assessment 2010 and 2012 but may be considered in the future as the resolution of reporting increases.
Produced as part of the Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric). These regions align with, and are nested within, the revised drainage divisions.
Australian Rivers, Lakes and water storages are all connected. The complex nature of our water system means that understanding these connections is vital for the effective management of water resources. The Geofabric is a specialised Geographic Information System. It is like a digital street directory of australia's important water features. It lets you map how water is moved, used and stored throughout the landscape. It is an authoritative information source that works seamlessly across australia. The Geofabric is made up of six datasets for use in hydrological visualisation, analysis and reporting. First up, the Hydrology reporting regions define australia's drainage divisions and river regions. This is used for reporting by government and other organisations. Hydrology Reporting Catchments are the building blocks of reporting regions. They provide finer detail for smaller rivers. Surface Cartography lets you visualise surface water features such as canals and bridges. This context is great for water managers and emergency services, for example to anticipate downstream communities affected by floods. This is achieved in combination with the Surface Network which links streamflows that can connect when there are high water flows. Visualising these full networks helps with streamflow forecasting. You can trace these connected and directed stream networks, and link them to Surface Catchments. This lets you identify the upstream contributing catchment area for a selected stream segment. Hydrologists use this to define networks and related catchments, and to inform environmental management and reporting. Groundwater Cartography shows groundwater resources and their features such as salinity as well as the rocks and sediments at different levels below the surface. This adds to the Geofabric’s detailed map of how our water system is connected. All information has been standardised across the country. This is why the Geofabric is widely used for streamflow analysis and the creation of customised catchments. Tutorials and a sample toolkit are available to help you perform common tasks. The Geofabric is continually being improved.

The dataset was derived from the 1 second Digital Surface Model by automatically removing vegetation offsets identified using vegetation maps. This product provides substantial improvements in the quality and consistency of the data relative to the original SRTM data, but is not free from artefacts. Man-made structures such as urban areas and power line towers have not been treated. The removal of vegetation effects has produced satisfactory results over most of the continent and areas with defects are identified in the User Guide.

What is ERP?
ERP links people to a place of usual residence within Australia. Usual residence is the address at which a person considers themselves to currently live. ERP includes all people who usually live in Australia (regardless of nationality, citizenship or legal status), with the exception of foreign diplomatic personnel and their families. It includes usual residents who are overseas for less than 12 months out of a continuous 16-month period. It excludes those who are in Australia for less than 12 months out of a continuous 16-month period. ERP is prepared by adding births, subtracting deaths and adding the net of overseas and internal migration to a base population derived from the latest Census of Population and Housing.

The SA2 estimates in this product are subject to some error. Some caution should be exercised when using the estimates, especially for areas with very small populations. Estimates of under three people should be regarded as synthetic due to confidentiality procedures. For further information about the data see: Regional Population Methodology.

Abstract
The Foundation Rail Infrastructure feature dataset is part of the Foundation Spatial Data Framework theme for Transport. The Foundation Rail Infrastructure feature dataset is specifically made up of Rail line features (Railways, Rail Sidings and Tramline including Light Rail) and Rail points (Stations). This feature class represents a national aggregation of the spatial locations and attributes of line and point features, of publicly available data. Rail Infrastructure information has been derived from various sources provided by data custodians including Spatial Services (NSW), Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy (QLD), Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (VIC), Land Tasmania (TAS) and Department of Infrastructure and Transport (SA).
The coverage is across all states and territories however due to restrictive licensing, Geoscience Australia data was used as the source data for Western Australia (lines and points), the Northern Territory (lines and points) and South Australia (points). Data published by Victoria falling within South Australia has been included (points).
Further information on datasets provided by State and Territory custodians can be found under Source Information in this metadata statement.

Lineage statement
Data supplied to Geoscience Australia from the custodians was processed to perform geometry validation (checks to remove corrupt geometries) and transform the attribute values to the national schema.
Minor spatial modifications have taken place to update attribute information in the source data for the national specification.
During translation, the length of the features in kilometres was also calculated (LENGTH_KM) using a geodesic distance calculation.
The Digital Atlas data team have republished and hosted the data as three separate layers:

Railways,
Rail Sidings,
Tram Lines.

The symbology applied displays the layers as operational or not operational, however queries can be performed using any operational status, refer to the data dictionary for filters and query options.

The unit for the sequestration amounts presented in the data are tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent sequestered annually.

Saltmarsh are coastal wetlands that are regularly inundated with tidal sea water and consist of salt tolerant species of grasses and herbs. Saltmarshes are found in temperate, subtropical and some tropical climatic regions and provide coastal protection by stabilising sediments and reducing wave action. Saltmarsh provide important habitat for small fish and invertebrates as well as grounds for feeding and roosting by migratory birds.

Carbon sequestration service accounts describe the gross amount of carbon dioxide equivalent sequestered by an ecosystem in an accounting area over an accounting period. The total sequestration is split according to carbon sequestered in soil and vegetation.

The dataset used in Young et al. (2020) was used to model carbon stocks. The data is raster data at a 100m resolution, with one raster providing the ecosystem and another providing the megagrams (tonnes) of carbon stored.

Towards A National Ocean Account is a discussion article that highlights learnings from the development of the Account. Feedback continues to be sought on the functionality and use of Phase 1 and 2 of the Account.

Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 7.0 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia. 89 biogeographic regions and 419 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia and its external territories (excluding Antarctica).
IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia.
In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions.
Various sources were used to delineate islands - these included the GA100K Admin layer plus the Australian Maritime Boundaries dataset, a Coral Sea dataset (held in ERIN) and the GA Commonwealth Fisheries 2006 dataset.

Key ecological features (KEFs) meet one or more of the following criteria:

a species, group of species, or a community with a regionally important ecological role (e.g. a predator, prey that affects a large biomass or number of other marine species);
a species, group of species, or a community that is nationally or regionally important for biodiversity;
an area or habitat that is nationally or regionally important for:
enhanced or high productivity (such as predictable upwellings - an upwelling occurs when cold nutrient-rich waters from the bottom of the ocean rise to the surface);
aggregations of marine life (such as feeding, resting, breeding or nursery areas);
biodiversity and endemism (species which only occur in a specific area); or

a unique seafloor feature, with known or presumed ecological properties of regional significance.

KEFs have been identified by the Australian Government on the basis of advice from scientists about the ecological processes and characteristics of the area. A workshop held in Darwin in 2007 also contributed to this scientific advice and helped to underpin the identification of key ecological features. As new information becomes available, the spatial representations of identified key ecological features will continue to be refined and updated.
Sixteen KEFs have been identified in the South-west Marine Region:

Commonwealth marine environment surrounding the Houtman Abrolhos Islands
Perth Canyon and adjacent shelf break, and other west coast canyons
Commonwealth marine environment within and adjacent to the west coast inshore lagoons
Commonwealth marine environment within and adjacent to Geographe Bay
Cape Mentelle upwelling
Naturaliste Plateau
Diamantina Fracture Zone
Albany Canyons group and adjacent shelf break
Commonwealth marine environment surrounding the Recherche Archipelago
Ancient coastline at 90-120m depth
Kangaroo Island Pool, canyons and adjacent shelf break, and Eyre Peninsula upwellings.
Meso-scale eddies (points).
Western demersal slope and associated fish communities.
Western rock lobster.

Reefs, cays and herbivorous fish of the Marion Plateau

Eight KEFs were identified in the Temperate East marine Region:

Tasmantid seamount chain
Lord Howe seamount chain

Bass cascade. No spatial representation available
Shelf rocky reefs and hard substrate. No spatial representation available

In order to create a spatial representation of KEFs for each Marine Region, some interpretation of the information was required. DCCEEW has made every effort to use the best available spatial information and best judgement on how to spatially represent the features based on the scientific advice provided. This does not preclude others from making their own interpretation of available information.

The Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric) identifies and registers the spatial relationships between important hydrological features such as watercourses, water bodies, canals, aquifers, monitoring points and catchments.
Geofabric Hydrology Reporting Regions are derived from aggregations of contracted catchments from Geofabric Hydrology Reporting Catchments. This product contains two candidate reporting regions, namely AWRA Drainage Division for national scale reporting purposes and River Region for regional scale reporting purposes. More reporting regions may be added in future releases based on user requirements.
The AWRA Drainage Division is defined for the purpose of providing a stable set of reporting regions specifically for the purpose of the Bureau’s Australian Water Resources Assessment and are referred to as the 2010 and 2012 Assessment Reporting Regions.
Australian Rivers, Lakes and water storages are all connected. The complex nature of our water system means that understanding these connections is vital for the effective management of water resources. The Geofabric is a specialised Geographic Information System. It is like a digital street directory of australia's important water features. It lets you map how water is moved, used and stored throughout the landscape. It is an authoritative information source that works seamlessly across australia. The Geofabric is made up of six datasets for use in hydrological visualisation, analysis and reporting. First up, the Hydrology reporting regions define australia's drainage divisions and river regions. This is used for reporting by government and other organisations. Hydrology Reporting Catchments are the building blocks of reporting regions. They provide finer detail for smaller rivers. Surface Cartography lets you visualise surface water features such as canals and bridges. This context is great for water managers and emergency services, for example to anticipate downstream communities affected by floods. This is achieved in combination with the Surface Network which links streamflows that can connect when there are high water flows. Visualising these full networks helps with streamflow forecasting. You can trace these connected and directed stream networks, and link them to Surface Catchments. This lets you identify the upstream contributing catchment area for a selected stream segment. Hydrologists use this to define networks and related catchments, and to inform environmental management and reporting. Groundwater Cartography shows groundwater resources and their features such as salinity as well as the rocks and sediments at different levels below the surface. This adds to the Geofabric’s detailed map of how our water system is connected. All information has been standardised across the country. This is why the Geofabric is widely used for streamflow analysis and the creation of customised catchments. Tutorials and a sample toolkit are available to help you perform common tasks. The Geofabric is continually being improved.

This publication is the fourth in an annual series that uses vehicle telematics data to provide measures of traffic congestion for freight vehicles for selected routes across Australia’s five mainland state capital cities—Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. The selected routes comprise the major motorways, highways and arterial roads within each city that service both passenger and freight vehicles. This release includes measures for 71 routes. The estimates presented in this report cover calendar year 2022, and include comparisons with 2021 traffic congestion levels.
This is the first year since the initial report, in 2019, where none of Australia’s capital cities experienced major lockdowns as part of the COVID-19 pandemic, and city-wide congestion levels have more or less returned to pre-pandemic levels. In particular, city-wide vehicle congestion, as measured by the mean excess time index, increased (worsened) in Sydney, Melbourne and, to a lesser extent, Adelaide between 2021 and 2022, but decreased (improved) in Brisbane and Perth. Many individual motorway routes exhibit increased congestion at morning and afternoon peaks in 2022, compared to 2020 and 2021. On some routes measured congestion is still lower than the pre-pandemic results in 2019. On other routes, congestion peaks exceed 2019 levels. Copies of the data displayed in the report are available here and on data.gov.au.

Lineage Statement
BITRE used freight telematics data to collate speeds experienced by freight vehicles on individual road segments. A sample of heavy vehicles was used to calculate median travel time for each road segment. Open Street Map (OSM) road segments were used. The methodology used to process the data is available in the BITRE github repository and on the National Freight Data Hub data catalogue.
A snapshot of the OSM data was taken in the January of the following year of analysis as it is the best representation of Australian roads as they were in that year. Only road types/segments of ""primary"", ""primary_link"", ""motorway"", ""motorway_link"", ""trunk"" and ""trunk_link"" are associated with congestion statistics and are included the geoJSON files.'

The geological definition of some provinces is contentious.
While every effort has been made to achieve a consensus interpretation of each province, including significant collaboration with state and territory geological surveys, scientific debate may still occur about the nature and extent of some provinces.The full 2D spatial extent (ie, including the extent of a province under any overlying cover material) of provinces has been captured.

Using the previous Emergency Management Facilities datasets (2018) acquired from State and Territory agencies, the data was uploaded into an ArcSDE environment using Feature Manipulation Engine (FME). The process included the extraction of the themed features, and the translation of the data into a schema created by the Built Environment & Exposure Section, National Location Information Branch, Geoscience Australia (GA). In 2023 further FME processing was completed where the dataset was address matched using the original address provided and compared with the Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF) data. If no address match occurred GIS specialists attempted to find a relevant corresponding G-NAF address to join to, where possible.

There is an issue in Map Viewer Classic with the display of grid cell values. The clickable area of each cell is shifted to the northwest. This can result in neighbouring pixel values being displayed. The underlying data is correct, and the values display correctly in the new Map Viewer and in ArcGIS Pro.
The Australian population grid 2022 is a modelled 1 km x 1 km grid representation of the estimated resident population (ERP) of Australia from 30 June 2022. The population grid is created by reaggregating estimated resident population data from Statistical Areas Level 1 (SA1) to a 1 km x 1 km grid across Australia based on point data representing residential address points. The value of each grid cell represents the estimated population density (number of people per square kilometre) within each 1 km x 1 km grid cell.

SA1 boundaries are defined by the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Edition 3 (2021) and the 1 km x 1 km grid is based on the National Nested Grid.

Data considerations
Caution must be taken when using the population grid as it presents modelled data only; it is not an exact measure of population across Australia.

Lineage statement
Using the previous Emergency Management Facilities datasets (2018) acquired from State and Territory agencies, the data was uploaded into an ArcSDE environment using Feature Manipulation Engine (FME). The process included the extraction of the themed features, and the translation of the data into a schema created by the Built Environment & Exposure Section, National Location Information Branch, Geoscience Australia (GA). In 2023 further FME processing was completed where the dataset was address matched using the original address provided and compared with the Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF) data. If no address match occurred GIS specialists attempted to find a relevant corresponding G-NAF address to join to, where possible.

Australia's Land Borders is a product within the Foundation Spatial Data Framework (FSDF) suite of datasets. It is endorsed by the ANZLIC – the Spatial Information Council and the Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping (ICSM) as the nationally consistent representation of the land borders as published by the Australian states and territories. It is topologically correct in relation to published jurisdictional land borders and the Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF).
The purpose of this product is to provide:

a building block which enables development of other national datasets;
integration with other geospatial frameworks in support of data analysis; and
visualisation of these borders as cartographic depiction on a map.

Although this service depicts land borders, it is not nor does it purport to be a legal definition of these borders. Therefore it cannot and must not be used for those use-cases pertaining to legal context.
The map image presented here contains three sub-layers:

Borderlines (Land Borders): This foundation dataset consists of edges (polylines) representing mediated segments of state and/or territory borders, connected at the nodes and terminated at the coastline defined as the Mean High Water Mark (MHWM) tidal boundary.  These polylines are attributed to convey information about provenance of the source.
It is envisaged that land borders will be topologically interoperable with the future national coastline dataset/s, currently being built through the ICSM coastline capture collaboration program.  Topological interoperability will enable closure of land mass polygon, permitting spatial analysis operations such as vector overlay, intersect, or raster map algebra. The Borderlines sub-layer is available separately here.
Termination Points are the point at which the state border polylines meet the coastline.  For the purpose of this product, the coastline is defined as the Mean High Water Mark (MHWM). In the absence of a new MHWM for NSW, the Jervis Bay termination points are defined by the NSW cadastre. The Termination Points sub-layer is available separately here.
In addition to Land Border polylines, the product incorporates a number of well-known survey-monumented corners which have historical and cultural significance associated with the place name. The corner markers have been created at the intersections of the relevant land borders. FSDF placenames was used as the name and spelling source of the corner markers.  The Corner Markers sub-layer is available separately here.

Source Information
Catalog entry: Australia's Land Borders
The Land Borders dataset is created using a range of source data including:

Australian Capital Territory data was sourced from the ACT Government GeoHub – ‘ACT Boundary’. No changes have been made to the polylines or vertices of the source data.
In the absence of any custodian published border for Jervis Bay – New South Wales, a border has been constructed from the boundary of the NSW cadastre supplied by NSW Spatial Services. Geoscience Australia’s GEODATA TOPO 250K data was considered as an alternative, however, that border terminated short of the coastline as it stops at the shoreline of the major water bodies. Therefore, a decision was made to use the NSW and OT supplied cadastre to create a new representation of the Jervis Bay border that continued to the coastline (MHWM), in place of the TOPO 250K data.
In the absence of publicly available data from New South Wales, the land borders for New South Wales have been constructed using the data of adjoining states Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. This approach is agreeable to New South Wales Government for this interim product.
In the absence of publicly available data from the Northern Territory the land borders for the Northern Territory have been constructed using the data of adjoining states Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia. This approach is agreeable to Northern Territory Government for this interim product.
Queensland state border and coastline data have been download from the Queensland Spatial, Catalogue – QSpatial.
Publicly available data for the state borders of South Australia was downloaded from data.gov.au and is ‘SA State Boundary - PSMA Administrative Boundaries’. Downloaded as a file geodatabase in GDA2020.
Victorian state border data has been downloaded from the Victorian state Government Spatial Datamart, it is titled ‘FR_FRAMEWORK_AREA_LINE’. The Victorian state border data was used for the NSW/VIC section of border due to the absence of any publicly available data from New South Wales for this section of the border.
Western Australian state border data was downloaded from the WA Government as publicly available. The Western Australia state border data has been used for the WA/NT section of the border due to the absence of publicly available data from Northern Territory for this section of the border. Selecting the SA data for the WA/SA border would introduce mismatches with the WA cadastre. It would also not improve the SA relationship with the SA cadastre. Using the WA data for the WA/SA section of the border aligns each state with its own cadastre without causing overlaps.

Lineage Statement
At the southwest end of the NT/SA/WA border the South Australian data for the border was edited by moving the end vertex ~1.7m to correctly create the intersection of the 3 states (SA/WA/NT).
At the southeast end of the NT/QLD/SA border the South Australian data for the border was edited by moving the end vertex ~0.4m to correctly create the intersection of the 3 states (NT/SA/QLD).
Queensland data was used for the NT/QLD border and the QLD/NSW border due to the absence of publicly available data from the Northern Territory for these section of the border.  Data published by Queensland also included a border sections running westwards along the southern Northern Territory border and southwards along the western New South Wales border.  These two sections were excluded from the product as they are not within the state of Queensland. Queensland data was also used in the entirety for the SA/QLD segment of the land borders.  Although the maximum overlap between SA and QLD state border data was less than ~5m (and varied along the border), the Queensland data closely matched its own cadastre and that of South Australia.  The South Australian data overlapped the Queensland data, it also did not match the South Australian cadastre.  Therefore, a decision to use the Queensland data for the QLD/SA section of the border ensured the best possible topological consistency with the published cadastre of each state.
The South Australian/Victorian state border, north-south, were generally very similar with some minor deviations from each other from less than 1m to ~60m (there is one instance of deviation of 170m). The section of border that follows the Murray River is matched, for the most part by both states. Over three quarters of the border running along the river is matched with both states. There is a mismatch between the states in the last quarter of the border along the river, the northern section, however, both states still have the border running inside, or along, the river polygon (Surface hydrology), the Victorian data was chosen for this section purely for consistency as the Victorian data was used for the preceding arcs.
Overall, the Victorian data was selected for use as the South Australia/Victoria land border. After taking the existing cadastre and GNAF points into account and it did not introduce extra errors into the relationship between the land borders and the cadastre of either state. In parts, it improved the relationship between the South Australian cadastre and the SA/VIC state border.
This interim product will be updated when all states and territories have published agreed, authoritative representations of their land borders. This product will also be updated to include land mass polygons at time when the Coastline Capture Program is complete. This dataset is GDA 2020 compliant - transformed into GDA2020 from it's original source datum. Reference System Code 2020.00.

Web Service for Collaborative Australian Protected Areas Database (CAPAD) 2022. CAPAD provides both spatial and text information about government, Indigenous and privately protected areas for continental Australia.
The Collaborative Australian Protected Areas Database (CAPAD) provides both spatial and textual information about government, Indigenous and privately protected areas for Australia, in both the marine and terrestrial environments. This dataset is for terrestrial data only. State, Territory and the large NGO conservation agencies supplied data current for 30 June 2022. This is the twelfth version of the terrestrial database, with previous versions released in 1997, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2020.
The Department also publishes protected areas data for the marine environment. ""CAPAD 2022 - Marine"" contains spatial and text information about offshore protected areas, for both State and Commonwealth waters. Previous versions of CAPAD marine information have been published in 1997, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2020.
CAPAD provides a snapshot of protected areas that meet the IUCN definition of a protected area: ""A protected area is a clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values."" (IUCN Definition 2008).
The department publishes a summary of the CAPAD data biennially on its website at http://www.environment.gov.au/capad/.

Surface Geology of Australia 2012 - Contacts contains all contacts between polygons of different stratigraphic units. Types include depositional, structural, igneous, metamorphic and compositional contacts.
The 1:2.5M scale geology of Australia data documents the distribution and age of major stratigraphic, intrusive and medium to high-grade metamorphic rock units of onshore Australia.
This edition contains the same geological content as previous editions (1998 to 2010), but is structured according to Geoscience Australia's 2012 data standards.
The dataset was compiled to use at scales between 1:2,500,000 and 1:5,000,000 inclusive.
The units distinguished/mapped mainly represent stratigraphic supergroups, regional intrusive associations and regional metamorphic complexes.
Groupings of Precambrian units in the time-space diagram are generally separated by major time breaks; Phanerozoic units are grouped according to stratigraphic age i.e. System/Period.
The time-space diagram has the added benefit that it provides a summary of units currently included on the themes.
The method used to distinguish sedimentary and many volcanic units varies for each geological eon as follows:

Cenozoic units are morphological units which emphasise the relationship of the sedimentary fill to the landscape;
Mesozoic units are regionally extensive to continent-wide time-rock units which emphasise the System of Period(s);
Paleozoic units are stratotectonic units that emphasise either the dominant System or Period(s) or the range of Periods;
Proterozoic units are commonly regional stratotectonic units - separated by major time breaks and split into the Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic Eras - which are generally unique to each cratonic region; and
Archean units are regional lithological units grouped into broad time divisions.

Metamorphic units are lithological units which emphasise the metamorphic facies and timing of the last major metamorphic event.
Igneous units are regional units which emphasise the dominant lithology and are grouped into broad time divisions.

Geoscience Australia catalog entry: Surface Geology of Australia 1:2.5 million scale dataset 2012 edition
Lineage statement
The geological content of the 2012 edition of the 1:2.5M surface geology of Australia is the same as the previous 2010 edition (ANZLIC dataset ID = ANZCW0703013817), restructured to comply with 2012 Geoscience Australia and international data standards.
The original data was compiled from digital data, mainly at 1:2 500 000 scale, supplied by AGSO, GSWA, NTGS, PIRSA, GSQ, GSTAS, GSNSW and GSVIC and from data obtained from many other groups.
In order to synthesise data from a variety of sources into a coherent product, the degree and nature of modification of the source data varied from case to case.
Cenozoic and Mesozoic units were derived from sources, including the Cenozoic Paleogeographic Atlas of Australia (Landford et al., 1995), the Geology of Australia 1986 and a compilation of Cenozoic basins in the Alice Springs region by B.R. Senior et al. (AGSO Record 1994/66).
The Phanerozoic units of southeastern Australia are substantially a modification of the 1:2 500 000 scale map entitled ""Stratotectonic and Structural Elements of the Tasman Fold Belt System"".
The geology of Tasmania is a generalisation of data assembled as part of the TASGO project (a GSTAS and AGSO/AGCRC venture completed in 1997).
The geology of South Australia is a highly generalised modification of the 1993 1:2 000 000 scale Geological Map of South Australia.
For the Precambrian compilation, much of the geology of Western Australia has been derived from the Geological Map of Western Australia, 1988 with some modifications.
The geology of the Kimberley, Halls Creek, Tanami and Arunta regions has been updated in line with recent mapping and some input from magnetic interpretation to emphasise relationships with the Tanami region.
The geology of the Amadeus region has been generalised from the 1:1 000 000 scale ""Structural Map of the Amadeus Basin"" (Compiler A.J. Stewart).
The geology of the Musgrave region has been re-compiled and simplified.
The geology of North Queensland has been generalised by D. Palfreyman and D. Pillinger from the ""North Qld Geology, 1997"" 1:1 000 000 scale map (compilers J.H.C. Bain & D. Haipola).

Metadata: Geoscape G-NAF Metadata Statement
Lineage Statement
National Address Points is built from Geoscape's quarterly released G-NAF psv text files. It uses the available data model in the G-NAF product description to appropriately join the tables into a flat structure and is geocoded using the latitude and longitude attributes in GDA2020. During development, decisions have been made to include or exclude certain attributes, as well as develop new ones where suitable. These decisions maintain the integrity of the original dataset and were made considering envisioned use case(s) and access of the dataset in the Digital Atlas of Australia.
Two additional attributes have been developed and included in the National Address Points dataset: COMPLETE_ADDRESS and MB_CENSUS_YEAR.

COMPLETE_ADDRESS is a concatenated, complete address string of the address components (i.e. Flat attributes, Level attributes, Lot attributes, Street Number attributes, Street Name attributes, Locality, State and Postcode).

MB_CENSUS_YEAR is the year of the ABS Census the Mesh Block data is extracted from. The psv file that with this information is dynamically named and attributed (with the year in the file name and attribute name). A method has been developed to ensure this is consistently and accurately populated.

Attributes excluded from the final National Address Points product are still accessible to users by downloading and joining to Geoscape's original G-NAF product, found at data.gov.au.
Original G-NAF attribute names, data types and data content included in National Address Points are not changed.

Boundaries of the areas are based on analysis done by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water of key environmental and socio-economic data.
The lines that make up the reserve boundaries were created/sourced as described below:

parallels and meridians were generated in ArcGIS and then densified to 0.025 decimal degrees (approx. 2.5km) prior to incorporation with other linework.
intermediate points along geodesic lines (note that, geodesic lines are the shortest line between points, they are not lines of constant bearing) were generated. A maximum segment length of 5km was used, which for this data ensures geodesic lines are within 1 metre of their true position.
maritime boundaries were sourced from AMB 2014a v3.0 (Geoscience Australia).
for Cocos (Keeling) Islands marine park, 30k coastline data (Geoscience Australia, 2010) was used to approximate the high water mark that describes part of the park boundary within the lagoon at South Keeling Islands. Orthophotography (Geoscience Australia, 2011) and 2011 coastline data (Geoscience Australia) were also used to derive the park boundaries of the two National Park Zones at South Keeling Islands
for the Christmas Island marine park, the inner boundary of the park was defined using three data sources; the Collaborative Australian Protected Areas database (DAWE, 2021), Normal Baselines Limit (AMB 2014a v3.0, Geoscience Australia) and the Port of Christmas Island boundary (created by DAWE as described in the Notice of Declaration of Security Regulated Port - Port of Christmas Island 2013).
For each Australian Marine Park, appropriate linework was generated and then used to construct polygons in ArcGIS.

Since this dataset was originally published in 2018 there have been the following updates:

A technical amendment was made on the basis of user feedback (30 April 2019). Macquarie Island was the only marine park affected by this amendment. The area calculation for Macquarie Island Marine Park was previously under reported by 483km2. This will have affected statistical analyses that used the calculated area (km2) as an input.
A zoning boundary error identified at West Island in Ashmore Reef Marine Park was corrected (March 2022).
Two new Australian Marine Parks were added to this dataset in March 2022; Christmas Island Marine Park and Cocos (Keeling) Islands Marine Park.

This dataset is a subset of Australian Geological Provinces 2018, 1:1 Million Scale and describes the extents of Paleozoic to Cenozoic sedimentary basins of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
The Australian Geological Provinces Database contains descriptions and spatial extents of the fundamental geological elements of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
Province types include sedimentary basins, tectonic provinces such as cratons and orogens, igneous provinces, and metallogenic provinces.
Spatial data has been captured largely at approximately 1:1M scale for intended use between 1:2M and 1:5M scale. This edition (2018.01) of the dataset is NOT a complete representation of all of Australia's geological provinces.
Further work is required to complete the national geological province collection. Additionally, not all the provinces supplied herein have undergone a rigorous quality assurance (QA) check to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their descriptions.
Where possible, provinces have been attributed with their age, contained lithostratigraphic units, relationships to other provinces, geological history, mineral resource occurrences, and selected published references.
The geological definition of some provinces is contentious.
While every effort has been made to achieve a consensus interpretation of each province, including significant collaboration with state and territory geological surveys, scientific debate may still occur about the nature and extent of some provinces. The full 2D spatial extent (ie, including the extent of a province under any overlying cover material) of provinces has been captured.
Additionally, the extent of outcrop of some provinces has also been captured. Where possible, the full extent outlines of provinces have been attributed with information about the source, accuracy, and observation method of those lines.

Lineage statement
The spatial data (polygons and lines) was compiled typically at or around 1:1 million scale from a wide range of published surface geology maps, bedrock or basement geology maps, borehole data, and geophysical imagery.
Where province boundaries crossed jurisdictional borders, Geoscience Australia worked with State and Territory geological agencies to achieve an agreed spatial extent.
Descriptive attribute data was compiled from authoritative published literature wherever possible, and names of these references are supplied with the data.
Not all the data in this edition of the dataset (2018.01) has undergone rigorous quality control.
All province descriptions in this edition of the dataset contain an indication of whether the data has been checked or not.

The unit for the carbon stock amount presented in the data is mega tonnes of carbon (MtC).

Saltmarsh are coastal wetlands that are regularly inundated with tidal sea water and consist of salt tolerant species of grasses and herbs. Saltmarshes are found in temperate, subtropical and some tropical climatic regions and provide coastal protection by stabilising sediments and reducing wave action. Saltmarsh provide important habitat for small fish and invertebrates as well as grounds for feeding and roosting by migratory birds.

Carbon stock accounts record the amount of carbon stored within an ecosystem in an accounting area and describe how totals have changed within the accounting period.

The dataset used in Young et al. (2020) was used to model carbon stocks. The data is raster data at a 100m resolution, with one raster providing the ecosystem and another providing the megagrams (tonnes) of carbon stored.

This dataset is a subset of Surface Geology of Australia 2012, 1:1M Scale symbolised by age classification.
The Surface Geology of Australia 1:1M scale dataset (2012 edition) is a seamless national coverage of outcrop and surficial geology, compiled for use at or around 1:1 million scale.
The data maps outcropping bedrock geology and unconsolidated or poorly consolidated regolith material covering bedrock.
Geological units are represented as polygon and line geometries, and are attributed with information regarding stratigraphic nomenclature and hierarchy, age, lithology, and primary data source.
The dataset also contains geological contacts, structural features such as faults and shears, and miscellaneous supporting lines like the boundaries of water and ice bodies.
The 2012 dataset has been updated from the previous 2010 data by updating geological unit data to 2012 information in the Australian Stratigraphic Units Database, incorporating new published mapping in the Northern Territory and Queensland, and correcting errors or inconsistent data identified in the previous edition, particularly in the Phanerozoic geology of Western Australia.
The attribute structure of the dataset has also been revised to be more compatible with the GeoSciML data standard, published by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information.
The first edition of this national dataset was first released in 2008, with map data compiled largely from simplifying and edgematching existing 1:250 000 scale geological maps.
Where these maps were not current, more recent source maps ranging in scale from 1:50 000 to 1:1 million were used.
In some areas where the only available geological maps were old and poorly located, some repositioning of mapping using recent satellite imagery or geophysics was employed.

This dataset is a subset of Australian Geological Provinces 2018, 1:1 Million Scale and describes the extents of Mesozoic to Cenozoic sedimentary basins of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
The Australian Geological Provinces Database contains descriptions and spatial extents of the fundamental geological elements of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
Province types include sedimentary basins, tectonic provinces such as cratons and orogens, igneous provinces, and metallogenic provinces.
Spatial data has been captured largely at approximately 1:1M scale for intended use between 1:2M and 1:5M scale. This edition (2018.01) of the dataset is NOT a complete representation of all of Australia's geological provinces.
Further work is required to complete the national geological province collection. Additionally, not all the provinces supplied herein have undergone a rigorous quality assurance (QA) check to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their descriptions.
Where possible, provinces have been attributed with their age, contained lithostratigraphic units, relationships to other provinces, geological history, mineral resource occurrences, and selected published references.
The geological definition of some provinces is contentious.
While every effort has been made to achieve a consensus interpretation of each province, including significant collaboration with state and territory geological surveys, scientific debate may still occur about the nature and extent of some provinces. The full 2D spatial extent (ie, including the extent of a province under any overlying cover material) of provinces has been captured.
Additionally, the extent of outcrop of some provinces has also been captured. Where possible, the full extent outlines of provinces have been attributed with information about the source, accuracy, and observation method of those lines.

The Mineral Potential web service provides access to digital datasets used in the assessment of mineral potential in Australia. The service includes maps showing the potential for sediment-hosted base metal mineral systems in Australia.
This product shows the potential for Clastic-Dominated Siliciclastic Mafic Zn-Pb (CDSM) mineral systems in Australia. This map is a synthesis of four component layers: sources of metals, energy drivers, lithospheric architecture, and depositional gradients, using a weighted sum to produce the final mineral potential map for the mineral system
Supporting datasets including the input maps used to generate the mineral potential maps, an assessment criteria table that contains information on the map creation, and data uncertainty maps are available here Uncertainty Maps. The data uncertainty values range between 0 and 1, with higher uncertainty values being located in areas where more input maps are missing data or have unknown values.

This web mapping application provides information about the
geographic distribution of relative socio-economic disadvantage and the
contributing indicator variables derived from 2021 Census data, thereby providing a deeper understanding of local area disadvantage and its drivers.

The data used in this web mapping
application is the Australian Bureau of Statistics Socio-Economic
Index for Areas Index (SEIFA), Index
Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage (IRSD) 2021 by Statistical Area 1
(SA1) geography (Australian
Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Edition 3) and includes mapping of
the standardised
variable proportions for each of the contributing IRSD indicator variables
associated with socio-economic disadvantage. Please note, in calculating the
SEIFA IRSD index the indicator variables are weighted, the standardised
variable proportions mapped in this application are unweighted.

The SEIFA Indexes are calculated from area
level data and therefore indicate the collective socio-economic characteristics
of the people living in an area. While an area may be identified as relatively disadvantaged
this does not mean that all individuals within that area are disadvantaged,
only that relative to other areas, this area has a high proportion of relatively disadvantaged people. For detailed
information on how to use the SEIFA data, please refer to the SEIFA
2021 Technical Paper. This application is designed primarily for desktop view.

Abstract This spatial product shows consistent ‘near real-time’ bushfire and prescribed burn boundaries for all jurisdictions who have the technical ability or appropriate licence conditions to provide this information. Currency Maintenance of the underlying data is the responsibility of the custodian. Geoscience Australia has automated methods of regularly checking for changes in source data. Once detected the dataset and feeds will be updated as soon as possible.

These were then confirmed by each jurisdiction through the EMSINA National and EMSINA Developers networks. This Webservice contains authoritative data sourced from: Australian Capital Territory - Emergency Service Agency (ESA) New South Wales - Rural Fire Service (RFS) Queensland - Queensland Fire and Emergency Service (QFES) South Australia - Country Fire Service (CFS) Tasmania - Tasmania Fire Service (TFS) Victoria – Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) Western Australia – Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) The completeness of the data within this webservice is reliant on each jurisdictional source and the information they elect to publish into their Operational Bushfire Boundary webservices. Known Limitations: This dataset does not contain information from the Northern Territory government. This dataset contains a subset of the Queensland bushfire boundary data. The Queensland ‘Operational’ feed that is consumed within this National Database displays a the last six (6) months of incident boundaries. In order to make this dataset best represent a ‘near-real-time’ or current view of operational bushfire boundaries Geoscience Australia has filtered the Queensland data to only incorporate the last two (2) weeks data. Geoscience Australia is aware of duplicate data (features) may appear within this dataset. This duplicate data is commonly represented in the regions around state borders where it is operationally necessary for one jurisdiction to understand cross border situations. Care must be taken when summing the values to obtain a total area burnt. The data within this aggregated National product is a spatial representation of the input data received from the custodian agencies. Therefore, data quality and data completion will vary. If you wish to assess more information about specific jurisdictional data and/or data feature(s) it is strongly recommended that you contact the appropriate custodian. The accuracy of the data attributes within this webservice is reliant on each jurisdictional source and the information they elect to publish into their Operational Bushfire Boundary webservices. Note: Geoscience Australia has, where possible, attempted to align the data to the (as of October 2023) draft National Current Incident Extent Feeds Data Dictionary. However, this has not been possible in all cases. Work to progress this alignment will be undertaken after the publication of this dataset, once this project enters a maintenance period. Catalog entry: Bushfire Boundaries – Near Real-Time Lineage Statement Version 1 and 2 (2019/20): This dataset was first built by EMSINA, Geoscience Australia, and Esri Australia staff in early January 2020 in response to the Black Summer Bushfires. The product was aimed at providing a nationally consistent dataset of bushfire boundaries. Version 1 was released publicly on 8 January 2020 through Esri AGOL software. Version 2 of the product was released in mid-February as EMSINA and Geoscience Australia began automating the product. The release of version 2 exhibited a reformatted attributed table to accommodate these new automation scripts. The product was continuously developed by the three entities above until early May 2020 when both the scripts and data were handed over to the National Bushfire Recovery Agency. The EMSINA Group formally ended their technical involvement with this project on June 30, 2020. Version 3 (2020/21): A 2020/21 version of the National Operational Bushfire Boundaries dataset was agreed to by the Australian Government. It continued to extend upon EMSINA’s 2019/20 Version 2 product. This product was owned and managed by the Australian Government Department of Home Affairs, with Geoscience Australia identified as the technical partners responsible for development and delivery. Work on Version 3 began in August 2020 with delivery of this product occurring on 14 September 2020. Version 4 (2021/22): A 2021/22 version of the National Operational Bushfire Boundaries dataset was produced by Geoscience Australia. This product was owned and managed by Geoscience Australia, who provided both development and delivery. Work on Version 4 began in August 2021 with delivery of this product occurring on 1 September 2021. The dataset was discontinued in May 2022 because of insufficient Government funding. Version 5 (2023/25): A 2023/25 version of the National Near-Real-Time Bushfire Boundaries dataset is produced by Geoscience Australia under funding from the National Bushfire Intelligence Capability (NBIC) - CSIRO. NBIC and Geoscience Australia have also partnered with the EMSINA Group to assist with accessing and delivering this dataset. This dataset is the first time where the jurisdictional attributes are aligned to AFAC’s National Bushfire Schema. Work on Version 5 began in August 2023 and was released in late 2023 under formal access arrangements with the States and Territories.

Surface Geology of Australia - Faults contains all brittle to ductile style structures, represented as lines, along which displacement has occurred, from a simple, single 'planar' brittle or ductile surface to a fault system comprised of many strands of both brittle and ductile nature.
The 1:2.5M scale geology of Australia data documents the distribution and age of major stratigraphic, intrusive and medium to high-grade metamorphic rock units of onshore Australia.
This edition contains the same geological content as previous editions (1998 to 2010), but is structured according to Geoscience Australia's 2012 data standards.
The dataset was compiled to use at scales between 1:2,500,000 and 1:5,000,000 inclusive.
The units distinguished/mapped mainly represent stratigraphic supergroups, regional intrusive associations and regional metamorphic complexes.
Groupings of Precambrian units in the time-space diagram are generally separated by major time breaks; Phanerozoic units are grouped according to stratigraphic age i.e. System/Period.
The time-space diagram has the added benefit that it provides a summary of units currently included on the themes.
The method used to distinguish sedimentary and many volcanic units varies for each geological eon as follows:

Cenozoic units are morphological units which emphasise the relationship of the sedimentary fill to the landscape;
Mesozoic units are regionally extensive to continent-wide time-rock units which emphasise the System of Period(s);
Paleozoic units are stratotectonic units that emphasise either the dominant System or Period(s) or the range of Periods;
Proterozoic units are commonly regional stratotectonic units - separated by major time breaks and split into the Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic Eras - which are generally unique to each cratonic region; and
Archean units are regional lithological units grouped into broad time divisions.

Metamorphic units are lithological units which emphasise the metamorphic facies and timing of the last major metamorphic event.
Igneous units are regional units which emphasise the dominant lithology and are grouped into broad time divisions.

Source information
Geoscience Australia catalog entry: Surface Geology of Australia 1:2.5 million scale dataset 2012 edition
Lineage statement
The geological content of the 2012 edition of the 1:2.5M surface geology of Australia is the same as the previous 2010 edition (ANZLIC dataset ID = ANZCW0703013817), restructured to comply with 2012 Geoscience Australia and international data standards.
The original data was compiled from digital data, mainly at 1:2 500 000 scale, supplied by AGSO, GSWA, NTGS, PIRSA, GSQ, GSTAS, GSNSW and GSVIC and from data obtained from many other groups.
In order to synthesise data from a variety of sources into a coherent product, the degree and nature of modification of the source data varied from case to case.
Cenozoic and Mesozoic units were derived from sources, including the Cenozoic Paleogeographic Atlas of Australia (Landford et al., 1995), the Geology of Australia 1986 and a compilation of Cenozoic basins in the Alice Springs region by B.R. Senior et al. (AGSO Record 1994/66).
The Phanerozoic units of southeastern Australia are substantially a modification of the 1:2 500 000 scale map entitled ""Stratotectonic and Structural Elements of the Tasman Fold Belt System"".
The geology of Tasmania is a generalisation of data assembled as part of the TASGO project (a GSTAS and AGSO/AGCRC venture completed in 1997).
The geology of South Australia is a highly generalised modification of the 1993 1:2 000 000 scale Geological Map of South Australia.
For the Precambrian compilation, much of the geology of Western Australia has been derived from the Geological Map of Western Australia, 1988 with some modifications.
The geology of the Kimberley, Halls Creek, Tanami and Arunta regions has been updated in line with recent mapping and some input from magnetic interpretation to emphasise relationships with the Tanami region.
The geology of the Amadeus region has been generalised from the 1:1 000 000 scale ""Structural Map of the Amadeus Basin"" (Compiler A.J. Stewart).
The geology of the Musgrave region has been re-compiled and simplified.
The geology of North Queensland has been generalised by D. Palfreyman and D. Pillinger from the ""North Qld Geology, 1997"" 1:1 000 000 scale map (compilers J.H.C. Bain & D. Haipola).

2021 Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2) are part of the Main Structure of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Edition 3.

SA2s are medium-sized general purpose areas built to represent communities that interact together socially and economically. Most SA2s have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 people. SA2s are built from whole Statistical Areas Level 1 (SA1), while whole SA2s aggregate to form Statistical Areas Level 3 (SA3) in the ASGS Main Structure.

The ASGS is a classification of Australia into a hierarchy of statistical areas. It is a social geography, developed to reflect the location of people and communities. It is used for the publication and analysis of official statistics and other data. The ASGS is updated every 5 years to account for growth and change in Australia’s population, economy and infrastructure.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) partnered with industry and other stakeholders to co-design methods to produce agriculture statistics using new data sources. Traditionally, agriculture area and production statistics are produced by the ABS through an annual agricultural survey or a five yearly agricultural census which collects information directly from farm businesses. These experimental canola estimates were an extension of previous experimental work undertaken for producing sugarcane statistics and, together, they demonstrate that these non-survey data sources can produce accurate and more timely statistics at a level of regional detail normally only available from an agricultural census.

The 2019-20 experimental estimates of canola production, local value, area grown and business numbers were produced by combining administrative data from the Grains Levy Payer Register with satellite derived crop mapping from Digital Agriculture Services. More information on the method and approach can be found here and feedback to further refine it is welcomed via email: agriculture.statistics@abs.gov.au.

Data points of ‘less than 5’ in the original data have been converted to blank cells as part of the web service production process due to the need for web service data to be integers only, whilst continuing to suppress any values less than 5. The original data containing ‘less than 5’ annotations can be accessed here.

The project team initially identified a list of potential source data through jurisdictional websites and the Emergency Management LINK catalogue. These were then confirmed by each jurisdiction through the EMSINA National and EMSINA Developers networks. This Webservice contains authoritative data sourced from: Australian Capital Territory - Emergency Service Agency (ESA) New South Wales - Rural Fire Service (RFS) Queensland - Queensland Fire and Emergency Service (QFES) South Australia - Country Fire Service (CFS) Tasmania - Tasmania Fire Service (TFS) Victoria – Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) Western Australia – Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) The completeness of the data within this webservice is reliant on each jurisdictional source and the information they elect to publish into their Operational Bushfire Boundary webservices. Known Limitations: This dataset does not contain information from the Northern Territory government. This dataset contains a subset of the Queensland bushfire boundary data. The Queensland ‘Operational’ feed that is consumed within this National Database displays a the last six (6) months of incident boundaries. In order to make this dataset best represent a ‘near-real-time’ or current view of operational bushfire boundaries Geoscience Australia has filtered the Queensland data to only incorporate the last two (2) weeks data. Geoscience Australia is aware of duplicate data (features) may appear within this dataset. This duplicate data is commonly represented in the regions around state borders where it is operationally necessary for one jurisdiction to understand cross border situations. Care must be taken when summing the values to obtain a total area burnt. The data within this aggregated National product is a spatial representation of the input data received from the custodian agencies. Therefore, data quality and data completion will vary. If you wish to assess more information about specific jurisdictional data and/or data feature(s) it is strongly recommended that you contact the appropriate custodian. The accuracy of the data attributes within this webservice is reliant on each jurisdictional source and the information they elect to publish into their Operational Bushfire Boundary webservices. Note: Geoscience Australia has, where possible, attempted to align the data to the (as of October 2023) draft National Current Incident Extent Feeds Data Dictionary. However, this has not been possible in all cases. Work to progress this alignment will be undertaken after the publication of this dataset, once this project enters a maintenance period. Catalog entry: Bushfire Boundaries – 3-Hourly Accumulation Lineage Statement Version 1 (2021/22): A 2021/22 version of the National 3 Hourly Cumulative Bushfire Boundaries dataset was produced by Geoscience Australia. This product was owned and managed by Geoscience Australia, who provided both development and delivery. Work on Version 1 of this dataset began in August 2021 with delivery occurring in September 2021. The dataset was discontinued in May 2022 due to insufficient Government funding. Version 2 (2023/25): A 2023/25 version of National Near-Real-Time Bushfire Boundaries dataset is produced by Geoscience Australia under funding from the National Bushfire Intelligence Capability (NBIC) - CSIRO. NBIC and Geoscience Australia have also partnered with the EMSINA Group to assist with accessing and delivering this dataset. This dataset is the first time where the jurisdictional attributes are aligned to AFAC’s National Bushfire Schema. Work on Version 2 began in August 2023 and was released in late 2023 under formal access arrangements with the States and Territories.

Data considerations
The input data was not collected or validated at SA2 level. Classes with small estimates are less reliable and should be used with caution. Any discrepancies between totals and sums of components in this publication are due to rounding.

Zeros can be real zeros (or rounded to zero), or data that is not available.

SA2s that cover Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island are not in scope of the account and do not contain values.

The monthly Building Approvals (BAPS) collection collects data relating to residential and non-residential building work above certain value limits that have been approved within the reference month. Data from this collection is an important leading economic indicator of future building activity. It also provides the sampling framework for the quarterly Building Activity Survey, which is a major contributor to the quarterly National Accounts estimates.

Building Approval statistics are used extensively by both public and private sector organisations to monitor economic activity, employment and investment.

Please note, the Building Approvals data from financial years 2014-15 to 2015-16 was originally published using the 2011 version of the ASGS boundaries. A small number of buildings approved during this period had lower quality address information. This may result in minor deviations from previously published state totals.

Lineage Statement
National Roads provides a single national digital view of road centrelines across the entirety 
of Australia. Roads is continuously built through sourcing a broad range of datasets 
from many organisations. This data is quality assured, standardised, integrated and 
topology-corrected before publication.
Road centrelines are primarily sourced from State and Territory governments and 
form the basis for the Roads network. Roads additional to the State and Territory 
provisions are digitised or integrated where reliable sources of road centrelines are 
identified that improves the quality and/or consistency of Roads nationally.
For attribution of Roads data sources refer to this webpage:
geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/.
The Digital Atlas of Australia team have published a hosted feature layer for National roads and a subset dataset called Major Roads in GDA2020 format.

Geoscience Australia catalog entry: Metamorphic rocks (National Geoscience Dataset)
Lineage statement
This data was produced by scanning and vectorising the published 1 : 5 000 000 Metamorphic Map of Australia (Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics,
Australia, 1983).
This original digital version (1995) contained several ArcInfo coverages: geological boundaries and coastline, major faults and trends.
In 1996, these individual coverages were re-projected to comply with the current national dataset projections and were combined into one dataset in which the linework and the
polygons were fully attributed as per the original 1983 edition.
The attributes of the dataset encompass all the map surrounds but have been subsequently revised and tailored to facilitate better use in the GIS environment.
As such the major attribute of the dataset is the ""rock_class"" which can be used to distinguish metamorphic and igneous rocks.
For metamorphic rocks the items fac_series and metagrade apply and for igneous the ig_class, era and lith_desc apply.

World Heritage sites have universal value that transcends the importance they hold for one particular nation.
These qualities are expressed in the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (the World Heritage Convention).
The World Heritage Convention aims to promote cooperation among nations to protect heritage from around the world that is of such outstanding universal value that its conservation is important for current and future generations.
There are currently twenty (20) Australian properties inscribed on the World Heritage List.
A single Australian World Heritage Areas database has been created by combining data which was historically stored as a separate data for each property. World Heritage Area buffer zones are also included in this dataset where they exist for some properties and are distinguished from the Declared Property boundary in the data.
Four properties (Kakadu National Park, Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, Willandra Lakes Region and the Tasmanian Wilderness) are inscribed for both natural and cultural criteria.
The Great Barrier Reef, the Tasmanian Wilderness, the Wet Tropics of Queensland and Shark Bay meet all four World Heritage criteria for natural heritage see http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria or http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/about/world/world-heritage-criteria.

This feature is a subset of Key ecological features.
Key ecological features (KEFs) meet one or more of the following criteria:

a species, group of species, or a community with a regionally important ecological role (e.g. a predator, prey that affects a large biomass or number of other marine species);
a species, group of species, or a community that is nationally or regionally important for biodiversity;
an area or habitat that is nationally or regionally important for:
enhanced or high productivity (such as predictable upwellings - an upwelling occurs when cold nutrient-rich waters from the bottom of the ocean rise to the surface);
aggregations of marine life (such as feeding, resting, breeding or nursery areas);
biodiversity and endemism (species which only occur in a specific area); or

a unique seafloor feature, with known or presumed ecological properties of regional significance.

KEFs have been identified by the Australian Government on the basis of advice from scientists about the ecological processes and characteristics of the area.
A workshop held in Darwin in 2007 also contributed to this scientific advice and helped to underpin the identification of key ecological features.
As new information becomes available, the spatial representations of identified key ecological features will continue to be refined and updated.
Sixteen KEFs have been identified in the South-west Marine Region:

Commonwealth marine environment surrounding the Houtman Abrolhos Islands
Perth Canyon and adjacent shelf break, and other west coast canyons
Commonwealth marine environment within and adjacent to the west coast inshore lagoons
Commonwealth marine environment within and adjacent to Geographe Bay
Cape Mentelle upwelling
Naturaliste Plateau
Diamantina Fracture Zone
Albany Canyons group and adjacent shelf break
Commonwealth marine environment surrounding the Recherche Archipelago
Ancient coastline at 90-120m depth

This dataset is a subset of Australian Geological Provinces 2018, 1:1 Million Scale and contains Cenozoic paleovalleys of the western protion of the Australian continent.
The Australian Geological Provinces Database contains descriptions and spatial extents of the fundamental geological elements of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
Province types include sedimentary basins, tectonic provinces such as cratons and orogens, igneous provinces, and metallogenic provinces.
Spatial data has been captured largely at approximately 1:1M scale for intended use between 1:2M and 1:5M scale. This edition (2018.01) of the dataset is NOT a complete representation of all of Australia's geological provinces.
Further work is required to complete the national geological province collection. Additionally, not all the provinces supplied herein have undergone a rigorous quality assurance (QA) check to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their descriptions.
Where possible, provinces have been attributed with their age, contained lithostratigraphic units, relationships to other provinces, geological history, mineral resource occurrences, and selected published references.
The geological definition of some provinces is contentious.
While every effort has been made to achieve a consensus interpretation of each province, including significant collaboration with state and territory geological surveys, scientific debate may still occur about the nature and extent of some provinces. The full 2D spatial extent (ie, including the extent of a province under any overlying cover material) of provinces has been captured.
Additionally, the extent of outcrop of some provinces has also been captured. Where possible, the full extent outlines of provinces have been attributed with information about the source, accuracy, and observation method of those lines.

This dataset is a subset of Australian Geological Provinces 2018, 1:1 Million Scale and describes the extents of Mesoproterozoic sedimentary basins of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
The Australian Geological Provinces Database contains descriptions and spatial extents of the fundamental geological elements of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
Province types include sedimentary basins, tectonic provinces such as cratons and orogens, igneous provinces, and metallogenic provinces.
Spatial data has been captured largely at approximately 1:1M scale for intended use between 1:2M and 1:5M scale. This edition (2018.01) of the dataset is NOT a complete representation of all of Australia's geological provinces.
Further work is required to complete the national geological province collection. Additionally, not all the provinces supplied herein have undergone a rigorous quality assurance (QA) check to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their descriptions.
Where possible, provinces have been attributed with their age, contained lithostratigraphic units, relationships to other provinces, geological history, mineral resource occurrences, and selected published references.
The geological definition of some provinces is contentious.
While every effort has been made to achieve a consensus interpretation of each province, including significant collaboration with state and territory geological surveys, scientific debate may still occur about the nature and extent of some provinces. The full 2D spatial extent (ie, including the extent of a province under any overlying cover material) of provinces has been captured.
Additionally, the extent of outcrop of some provinces has also been captured. Where possible, the full extent outlines of provinces have been attributed with information about the source, accuracy, and observation method of those lines.

This publication is the fourth in an annual series that uses vehicle telematics data to provide measures of traffic congestion for freight vehicles for selected routes across Australia’s five mainland state capital cities—Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. The selected routes comprise the major motorways, highways and arterial roads within each city that service both passenger and freight vehicles. This release includes measures for 71 routes. The estimates presented in this report cover calendar year 2022, and include comparisons with 2021 traffic congestion levels.
This is the first year since the initial report, in 2019, where none of Australia’s capital cities experienced major lockdowns as part of the COVID-19 pandemic, and city-wide congestion levels have more or less returned to pre-pandemic levels. In particular, city-wide vehicle congestion, as measured by the mean excess time index, increased (worsened) in Sydney, Melbourne and, to a lesser extent, Adelaide between 2021 and 2022, but decreased (improved) in Brisbane and Perth. Many individual motorway routes exhibit increased congestion at morning and afternoon peaks in 2022, compared to 2020 and 2021. On some routes measured congestion is still lower than the pre-pandemic results in 2019. On other routes, congestion peaks exceed 2019 levels. Copies of the data displayed in the report are available here and on data.gov.au.

Lineage Statement
BITRE used freight telematics data to collate speeds experienced by freight vehicles on individual road segments. A sample of heavy vehicles was used to calculate median travel time for each road segment. Open Street Map (OSM) road segments were used. The methodology used to process the data is available in the BITRE github repository and on the National Freight Data Hub data catalogue.
A snapshot of the OSM data was taken in the January of the following year of analysis as it is the best representation of Australian roads as they were in that year. Only road types/segments of ""primary"", ""primary_link"", ""motorway"", ""motorway_link"", ""trunk"" and ""trunk_link"" are associated with congestion statistics and are included the geoJSON files.'

This dataset is a subset of Surface Geology of Australia 2012,1:2.5M Scale symbolised by age classification.
Attributes include summary geological information for each unit polygon, and metadata about the capture and recommended portrayal of the polygons.
The 1:2.5M scale geology of Australia data documents the distribution and age of major stratigraphic, intrusive and medium to high-grade metamorphic rock units of onshore Australia.
This edition contains the same geological content as previous editions (1998 to 2010), but is structured according to Geoscience Australia's 2012 data standards.
The dataset was compiled to use at scales between 1:2,500,000 and 1:5,000,000 inclusive.
The units distinguished/mapped mainly represent stratigraphic supergroups, regional intrusive associations and regional metamorphic complexes.
Groupings of Precambrian units in the time-space diagram are generally separated by major time breaks; Phanerozoic units are grouped according to stratigraphic age i.e. System/Period.
The time-space diagram has the added benefit that it provides a summary of units currently included on the themes.
The method used to distinguish sedimentary and many volcanic units varies for each geological eon as follows:

Cenozoic units are morphological units which emphasise the relationship of the sedimentary fill to the landscape;
Mesozoic units are regionally extensive to continent-wide time-rock units which emphasise the System of Period(s);
Paleozoic units are stratotectonic units that emphasise either the dominant System or Period(s) or the range of Periods;
Proterozoic units are commonly regional stratotectonic units - separated by major time breaks and split into the Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic Eras - which are generally unique to each cratonic region; and
Archean units are regional lithological units grouped into broad time divisions.

Metamorphic units are lithological units which emphasise the metamorphic facies and timing of the last major metamorphic event.
Igneous units are regional units which emphasise the dominant lithology and are grouped into broad time divisions.

Source information
Geoscience Australia catalog entry: Surface Geology of Australia 1:2.5 million scale dataset 2012 edition
Lineage statement
The geological content of the 2012 edition of the 1:2.5M surface geology of Australia is the same as the previous 2010 edition (ANZLIC dataset ID = ANZCW0703013817), restructured to comply with 2012 Geoscience Australia and international data standards.
The original data was compiled from digital data, mainly at 1:2 500 000 scale, supplied by AGSO, GSWA, NTGS, PIRSA, GSQ, GSTAS, GSNSW and GSVIC and from data obtained from many other groups.
In order to synthesise data from a variety of sources into a coherent product, the degree and nature of modification of the source data varied from case to case.
Cenozoic and Mesozoic units were derived from sources, including the Cenozoic Paleogeographic Atlas of Australia (Landford et al., 1995), the Geology of Australia 1986 and a compilation of Cenozoic basins in the Alice Springs region by B.R. Senior et al. (AGSO Record 1994/66).
The Phanerozoic units of southeastern Australia are substantially a modification of the 1:2 500 000 scale map entitled ""Stratotectonic and Structural Elements of the Tasman Fold Belt System"".
The geology of Tasmania is a generalisation of data assembled as part of the TASGO project (a GSTAS and AGSO/AGCRC venture completed in 1997).
The geology of South Australia is a highly generalised modification of the 1993 1:2 000 000 scale Geological Map of South Australia.
For the Precambrian compilation, much of the geology of Western Australia has been derived from the Geological Map of Western Australia, 1988 with some modifications.
The geology of the Kimberley, Halls Creek, Tanami and Arunta regions has been updated in line with recent mapping and some input from magnetic interpretation to emphasise relationships with the Tanami region.
The geology of the Amadeus region has been generalised from the 1:1 000 000 scale ""Structural Map of the Amadeus Basin"" (Compiler A.J. Stewart).
The geology of the Musgrave region has been re-compiled and simplified.
The geology of North Queensland has been generalised by D. Palfreyman and D. Pillinger from the ""North Qld Geology, 1997"" 1:1 000 000 scale map (compilers J.H.C. Bain & D. Haipola).

Product Created 20 April 2023
Product Published 16 August 2023
A large number of published datasets were individually transformed to summarise our current understanding of the spatial extents of key mineral system mappable criteria. These individual layers were integrated using statistically derived importance weightings combined with expert reliability weightings within a mineral system component framework to produce national-scale mineral potential assessments for Australian carbonatite-related rare earth element mineral systems.

The Historical Bushfire Boundaries Dataset (version 2) represents the aggregation of jurisdictional supplied burnt areas polygons that date from the early 1900s through to 2023 (excluding the Northern Territory). The burnt areas represent curated jurisdictional owned polygons of bushfires and prescribed (planned) burns.
This dataset was produced under Work Stream 1C - Activity 3 of the National Bushfire Intelligence Capability (NBIC) , a collaborative partnership between:

Australian Climate Service
CSIRO (NBIC)
Geoscience Australia
Emergency Management Spatial Information Network (EMSINA)

Under agreement this Project (Activity 3) will release a nationally consistent, harmonised and standardised historical bushfire boundary dataset derived from the authoritative state and territory agencies in both 2023 (this dataset) and again in November 2024.
The information released within this dataset is reflective of the data supplied by participating authoritative agencies. It may, or may not, represent all fire history within that jurisdiction.
Geoscience Australia's role within this project is to:

negotiate access to the state/territory historic bushfire boundary datasets
aggregate, harmonise and standardise the jurisdictional data against the Australasian Fire Authorities Council (AFAC) National Bushfire Boundary Standards
host the completed spatial product(s)
arrange for the 'Historical Bushfire Boundaries' spatial dataset to be accessible through Geoscience Australia’s external data catalogues and through the new Digital Atlas of Australia platform
ensure stakeholders have access to regular project updates.

To harmonsise and standardise this dataset Geoscience Australia have utilised the AFAC endorsed data dictionary for fire history. This data dictionary and the definitions provided allowed Geoscience Australia to map common attributes from both sources. Unfortunately, not all attributes mapped across like-for-like. This resulted in Geoscience Australia either modifying or joining some of the jurisdictional attributes to fit or Geoscience Australia added them during the processing stage.

Lineage Statement
This dataset extends upon the first version of this dataset to be built and released under the Australia Research Data Commons Project in early 2023.
This dataset (version 2) represents an updated aggregation of each jurisdiction (except the Northern Territory) fire history data to include information from the 2022-23 bushfire season.
Agencies that have provided data include:

Australian Capital Territory Parks and Conservation
New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service
Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service
South Australia Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources
Tasmania Department of Natural Resources and Environment
Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning
Western Australia Department of Fire and Emergency Services

The Northern Territory Government is progressing in the development of their Bushfire Boundary Capabilities. Work is underway with the relevant agencies to incorporate Northern Territory Government approved Historical Bushfire Boundary data in the future.
Product standardisation:
The data provided by each jurisdiction is standardised and harmonised.  This process maps the existing state/territory attributes to the National Data Schema that was agreed to and endorsed by the participating state agencies and the Australian Fire and Emergency Services Authorities Council.
The Digital Atlas of Australia data team published an optimised Bushfire Boundaries Historic dataset designed to perform efficiently in either a desktop application or a web service.
This process utilised FME to reduce the processing time on millions of vertices within the complex dataset:

Dataset projected to epsg:4326 to align with the near real time services hosted on the Digital Atlas of Australia
Removes island or donut polygons within a fire extent, therefore a fire extent is shown with an outline and no internal parts
Create separate polygon chunks based on 10000 vertices while maintaining the same attributes for each chunk of the identified fire, if a fire consists of multiple polygons each polygon is counted separately within the identified fire

As a result the Bushfire Boundaries Historic dataset hosted in the Digital Atlas of Australia has more records than the original dataset.

This dataset is a subset of Australian Geological Provinces 2018, 1:1 Million Scale and describes the extents of Early to Late Paleozoic sedimentary basins of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
The Australian Geological Provinces Database contains descriptions and spatial extents of the fundamental geological elements of the Australian continent and offshore surrounds.
Province types include sedimentary basins, tectonic provinces such as cratons and orogens, igneous provinces, and metallogenic provinces.
Spatial data has been captured largely at approximately 1:1M scale for intended use between 1:2M and 1:5M scale. This edition (2018.01) of the dataset is NOT a complete representation of all of Australia's geological provinces.
Further work is required to complete the national geological province collection. Additionally, not all the provinces supplied herein have undergone a rigorous quality assurance (QA) check to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their descriptions.
Where possible, provinces have been attributed with their age, contained lithostratigraphic units, relationships to other provinces, geological history, mineral resource occurrences, and selected published references.
The geological definition of some provinces is contentious.
While every effort has been made to achieve a consensus interpretation of each province, including significant collaboration with state and territory geological surveys, scientific debate may still occur about the nature and extent of some provinces.The full 2D spatial extent (ie, including the extent of a province under any overlying cover material) of provinces has been captured.
Additionally, the extent of outcrop of some provinces has also been captured. Where possible, the full extent outlines of provinces have been attributed with information about the source, accuracy, and observation method of those lines.

Lineage statement
The spatial data (polygons and lines) was compiled typically at or around 1:1 million scale from a wide range of published surface geology maps, bedrock or basement geology maps, borehole data, and geophysical imagery.
Where province boundaries crossed jurisdictional borders, Geoscience Australia worked with State and Territory geological agencies to achieve an agreed spatial extent.
Descriptive attribute data was compiled from authoritative published literature wherever possible, and names of these references are supplied with the data.
Not all the data in this edition of the dataset (2018.01) has undergone rigorous quality control.
All province descriptions in this edition of the dataset contain an indication of whether the data has been checked or not.
